    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can think of it as the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that term by the coefficient from the second part. Wait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient of the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product is a term from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it. But no, when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the overall expression, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, the \\(c\\) terms would just be coefficients attached to them. So, in effect, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me try another approach. Let me consider that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), any term in the second polynomial will just be a coefficient multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, as calculated before, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{384}\n\\]"

Wait, no, because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not the case. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a single term with coefficient 6. When you multiply this term by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But wait, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient times \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me check: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, which is a very large number. But maybe that's correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second expansion as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me re-read it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense, as it would require finding the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we know is 6. Then, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), so 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems more complicated, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by considering the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1.

But that would be a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). However, the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only part of the entire term.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second part. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part of the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\), and the term is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would be different, but as it's phrased, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

Because if I have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^0\\), then when I multiply them, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), which is exactly what we're looking for. So, I think that's the case. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem here as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term where the \\(c\\) part is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, does that make sense? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and then we need the term where \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the combined term is \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 c^0 = 120 a^2b^2\\). So yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, since each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found, and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(term in }c)\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything because we're not considering them. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) comes from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(4 - 2 = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the product will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as an independent variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product as a single expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is the sum of all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 384, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as before. Now, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) is the middle term when the exponent is zero. Let's find that. The general term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we consider all possible \\(c\\) exponents, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems inconsistent because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a specific number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), meaning that we're looking for the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", implying a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) have exponents 2 each and \\(c\\) has exponent 0. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. But let me check once more. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\sum\\) of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a single number. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would mean I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, to find this, I can consider that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there any other term that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? No, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would contribute a factor that's multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by 1, meaning the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would remain 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that each term becomes just its coefficient. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again.

But wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when we multiply that by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) terms, but the problem statement just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial would just multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by that term's coefficient, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific \\(c\\) term, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Each term in this expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it would contribute to the overall coefficient. But actually, no. Wait, let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be the product of each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), and then it would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which would mean it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, so it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then when multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the \\(c\\) terms, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire expression and see how the terms combine. Let me write out the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be 6a^2b^2 multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes that coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we sum all those coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each factor. But that's not quite right because the two factors are in different variables. Wait, actually, since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the entire second factor, because the second factor doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But if we're considering the coefficient as a numerical value, regardless of \\(c\\), then we need to find the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply each term by 6 and see if that makes sense. Let me try that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing any subtlety. Is there any possibility that the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we're supposed to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles and each time I arrive at 384. So, I'm pretty confident that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient in the entire product, which would be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the coefficient would then involve terms with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the terms involving \\(c\\) might cancel out or something? Or maybe it's a typo, and the problem is supposed to be in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems odd because the product would have terms with \\(c\\) as well. Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. Because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense for a coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's proceed with that understanding.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, but only for the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because we want the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, to find the coefficient, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, from the expansion above, \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\) implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), which means \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but since we're only interested in the terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we take the coefficient from the second part where \\(c^0\\) is present, which is 20, and multiply by 6, giving 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part, but since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that it's considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that wouldn't make sense because it's not a single coefficient but a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is not present. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number, 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as a single expansion. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so their product is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you have two independent variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), their coefficients multiply when you take the product of the polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that implies that when we multiply the two expressions, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any other term would involve some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, but since we're looking for a term without \\(c\\), only the constant term (where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(2m = 6\\) \u21d2 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the terms where the \\(c\\) parts don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (i.e., the constant term), we only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent binomial expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the respective coefficients from each expansion. Since the second expansion only contributes a constant term, which is 20, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made a mistake here.

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit confusing. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms from the second expansion, which are \\(c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, not an expression in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then the coefficient would involve all the terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I should check the problem again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a Laurent polynomial, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would involve both expansions. Let me try that approach. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, as we found. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's the answer. Wait, but let me confirm that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the term \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. Alternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a Laurent polynomial, which doesn't seem right. So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's correct. Alternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that would be the case if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). However, since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a Laurent polynomial, meaning that the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a Laurent polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient,\" which is usually a number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, after considering both possibilities, I believe the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from this part is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, say \\( (x + y) \\) and \\( (z + w) \\), then when you expand, each term is a product of one term from the first and one from the second. So, in our case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc., and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms involving \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), etc., and their reciprocals. So, when we multiply these together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in order for the product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to result in a term without \\(c\\), the term from the second expansion must be a constant term, i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because any other term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, and thus the product would involve \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, first, let's get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier to be 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand this using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of these two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any errors in the calculations. So, yeah, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a multiple of a power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient to that term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), effectively making the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as each term in the product being \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second polynomial, but when considering the entire product, it's actually the sum of all those products. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of the coefficients. So, yeah, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Evaluating the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But that doesn't seem right either because the second part has multiple terms. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions, each term in the first expansion will multiply each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, the coefficient for those would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial has multiple terms. Wait, no, the second polynomial is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because for each term in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has coefficients, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, as I calculated before, the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify this another way. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think again: when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're just looking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64.

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part is in \\(c\\), maybe the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) when expanded has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term when multiplied. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), like \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by 6, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. When you multiply these two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term from the \\(c\\) part will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. I think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the steps are: 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. 2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the constant term, which is 20. 3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second polynomial only has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these are just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero? That can't be right because the problem is asking for it, implying that it's non-zero. So, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need to consider the expansion of both parts, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems plausible. So, let me try that approach. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). Setting this equal to 0 to find the constant term:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
