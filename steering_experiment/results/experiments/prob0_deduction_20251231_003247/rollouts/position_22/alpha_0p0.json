But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the terms combine. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. But I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But I think the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). So, simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But wait, no, that's not right. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is stated as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's looking for a numerical coefficient, implying that perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are to be treated as separate variables, and the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out to \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would require that the exponents of \\(c\\) in each term cancel out. So, let me try that approach. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), i.e., \\(c^{6 - 2m} = c^0\\), which implies \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Let me double-check that. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out is when the exponent is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has a non-zero coefficient will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is some exponent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not quite right because each term in the second polynomial is not just a constant but a term with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-(6 - m)}\\) or something like that. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just come from the first polynomial, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would have an additional factor of \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only appear if the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let me work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) => \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me check my reasoning again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the second part contributes a factor of 20 when \\(c^0\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 20 + \\text{other terms with } c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(6a^2b^2 * 20\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem down into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient for this term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that scales the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion and see if that makes sense. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\).

So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, if I have \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) is 6, and when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will have a coefficient, and when you multiply 6 by each of those coefficients, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(Q(c)\\) will be 6 times each coefficient in \\(Q(c)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the possible coefficients from \\(Q(c)\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I didn't substitute \\(c = 1\\), I could consider that each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when I multiply by 6, the coefficient becomes 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term.

So, I think that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms each of which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions together, each term from the first will be multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), setting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion, but no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it would still be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the product. But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't what the problem is asking for. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients, which would be if I set \\(c = 1\\). But that would give me the total sum, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Let me confirm this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. Therefore, when multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them out, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will be multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, I think that the coefficient will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems confusing because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms. Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by that term, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right either. Let me clarify: the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a term like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(coefficient)} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Now, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting 1 into the expression will make each term just its coefficient. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Is that correct? Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you're essentially taking the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense. Alternatively, I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the second part contributes all its terms multiplied by that coefficient. So, yeah, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, 6 * 64 = 384.

That would make more sense because then we're looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would require that we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already determined is 6. Then, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product, we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Wait, but the original problem just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c^0\\). So, maybe I need to clarify whether the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times that expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently, and the \\(c\\) terms are part of the expression, but we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, implying a numerical value. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me double-check my reasoning. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\).

But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), the expression becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\).

So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\).

Hmm, that seems too broad. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would require that in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because then when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, going back to the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, when we multiply these two together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient we're looking for is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2*3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, that part is correct. Then, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, when we multiply these two together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which is a bit ambiguous, but given the context, I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because a coefficient is a scalar, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think 120 is the right answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, you'll get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6 to get the overall coefficient. So, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Well, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term in the second part. Any other term in the second expansion would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the resulting term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.

Hmm, that seems correct, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a separate polynomial. So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're effectively distributing \\(6a^2b^2\\) across each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiple when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that the correct approach? Because when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\).

So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's just the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1 (from the term \\(a^2\\)). Then, the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be \\(1 \\times 2 = 2\\). Let's verify by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\): \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The term with \\(a^2\\) would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which, when considering coefficients as numbers, would be 2. So, yes, that works. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient should indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the multinomial theorem? Let me think. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's the product of the two coefficients. Wait, but actually, no, because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), those terms become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes its coefficient to the product, so the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its entire expansion is just a scalar when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach to confirm. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but I just want to make absolutely sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product is 1\u00d72=2, which matches the expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 (from \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\)), giving 4. Wait, but when I expand \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2\u00d7(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 2\u00d72=4. That works too.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient should be 6\u00d764=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute a factor that multiplies the entire \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Since we're not concerned with the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6\u00d764=384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will multiply each term in the expansion of the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in the second expansion, say \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, unless \\(k = 0\\), the term won't just be \\(a^2b^2\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, if you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 from the first part, and then you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another polynomial, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient of 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either because each term in the second polynomial is a monomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in the second polynomial, so actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, you get terms that are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are in terms of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 36a^2b^2c^4, 90a^2b^2c^2, 120a^2b^2, 90a^2b^2c^{-2}, 36a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, because that's the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant is 20. Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by this term, you get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 6 times 64, which is 384, but that was wrong because I was considering all coefficients, but actually, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the correct coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me confirm this. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term of 20. So, when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is when \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is 6. Next, we identify the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives the coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not the case because the product is a polynomial where each term is a product of terms from each factor. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = B\\). Then the product is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). When multiplied by \\(B\\), each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and \\(B\\) is a separate polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, I must have misunderstood something. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in other words, when you expand both parts and multiply them together, what is the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that term would be present in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms, which isn't a number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. If that's the case, then I need to consider both parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) => \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer should be 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, I realized that since the problem was asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and considering the other part involves \\(c\\), I needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I did by solving \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors, so I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we can consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would be incorrect because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to different terms in the overall expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\), perhaps we can consider that when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because only then will the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\) result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key. So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and when I multiply it by 6, that will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, let me work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But only the term with \\(c^0\\) will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't what we're looking for. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) and the coefficient from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I correctly identified that I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I correctly realized that when multiplying by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. I then correctly expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, found that the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), and calculated the binomial coefficient as 20. Finally, I multiplied 6 by 20 to get 120. So, I think my answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.
