    "text": " The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, but that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean the coefficient when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes sense. So, first, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need to find the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be formed by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which has coefficient 6) by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part (which has coefficient 20). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me check if I missed anything. So, in the first part, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) and we correctly found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, in the second part, we're looking for the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and we found that to be 20. So, when we multiply these two parts together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) exponent is 0, we only consider the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, yeah, I think that's correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by solving \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which as a sum of coefficients is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is indeed 64. So, 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales that term by that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), it's 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. I think that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems a bit strange because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because usually, when asking for a coefficient, it's a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which might not make sense. Wait, no, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve considering all possible products from the two expansions, but that might not make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) in the other. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that might not be what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire coefficient as a polynomial, but usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it's a number. Therefore, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let me calculate that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the other part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the other part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would involve considering all possible terms, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which is not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering the product of the two expansions. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems to be the case, but it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to write that as the answer, but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the two expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible products of terms from the two expansions that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion is in \\(c\\), which is a separate variable, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.

But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me try to clarify. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial.

Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a single term in the expansion. So, to find that, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) from the second polynomial. So, that seems like a reasonable approach. So, first, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is formed by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but hold on, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I misinterpreted it. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps it's not considering the \\(c\\) terms at all. That is, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term has both \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. But that doesn't make sense either because the entire expression is a product, so the terms are combined. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that's why I think my earlier approach is correct, giving a coefficient of 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so it's part of the product. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

Because any other term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would have a \\(c\\) term, and since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write that expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\) on \\(c\\). Now, I'm looking for the constant term, which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So that's 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, that would indeed be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me just double-check my calculations. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But that seems a bit odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that after expanding both parts, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because a coefficient is usually a constant.

So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. That makes more sense.

Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\)) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 6} = 20c^0 = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.

Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial.

Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and \\(ab\\) is 2, and \\(b^2\\) is 1. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1*(1 + 1) = 2, since the sum of coefficients is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 2*2=4. And the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1*2=2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\), which is 2. So, that works.

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), those other terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit off because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) isn't a single number, it's a sum of terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, it's treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, and the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by the coefficient from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients. So, to find the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms, each multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial has terms in \\(c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) aren't affected by the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I can find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and that should give me the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) would be the product of these two coefficients. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the constant term, which is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's also correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, so that should be the coefficient. I think that makes sense because when you multiply two terms, their coefficients multiply as well. So, yeah, I think 120 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all the terms, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product also includes the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as a variable separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is a bit strange because usually, a coefficient is a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct?

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then yes, it would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if I don't set \\(c = 1\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give me a polynomial in \\(c\\).

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient is 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient is the entire expansion, which is a sum of terms. So, when you multiply, each term in the \\(c\\) expansion gets multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part. Since the sum of the coefficients in the \\(c\\) part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check.

So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But if I'm just asked for the coefficient, without specifying a particular power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the answer is 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 384, which is 6 * 64.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving \\(c\\) raised to some power, and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a part of the product, and the rest can be any power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, that seems correct. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term will have a coefficient, and all those coefficients will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6, as I found earlier, and the sum of all coefficients in the second part is when \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, let's compute that. When \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), contributes a factor that is multiplied by this term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found before. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about expanding both expressions separately and then multiplying, but I think that would just lead to the same result. Wait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me consider an example with smaller exponents to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product. Well, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\). The second part, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), is \\(c + 1/c\\), whose coefficients are 1 and 1. So, the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 times (1 + 1) = 2. Alternatively, if I compute the entire product, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\), and looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the variables don't combine to form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but rather each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, but in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be zero because in the product, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), giving \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier approach. So, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Wait, so in this small example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier method, I would have taken the coefficient from the first part, which is 1, and multiplied it by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, giving 2, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient is zero. So, that means my approach is wrong. Therefore, I need to rethink this. So, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second polynomial that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify this with my small example. In the small example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 0 because \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) has terms \\(c^1\\) and \\(c^{-1}\\), no constant term. So, 1 times 0 is 0, which matches the actual product where there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, this approach seems correct. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion.\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).\n   - This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\).\n   - Coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer**: The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think we need to consider all possible terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms interact. Wait, no, that's not possible because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't sound right because the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\). So, maybe I should find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) at \\(c^0\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, that seems more accurate. So, earlier I thought the sum of coefficients was 64, but that's when \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of all coefficients, but in reality, since we only want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, the coefficient is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just one term, the coefficient in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^m\\) or something like that. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the product that result in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion, but each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), effectively scaling the coefficients. But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient is 120. Let me just verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term of 20. When we multiply these together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms in the product will have additional powers of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term without \\(c\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with \\(c\\).

So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those terms would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate factor and just compute its expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), would contribute a factor that is the sum of all its coefficients, because each term in the expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any \\(c\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion, each term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term's coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so yes, that would mean multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire expansion of the second part, which effectively is the sum of the coefficients. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me double-check by another method. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the entire product as two separate expansions and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by considering all possible ways that term can arise. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion (with coefficient 6) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But wait, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables, like \\(c\\), are not part of that term. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that means we need to sum the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the coefficient in the second expansion for that specific \\(k\\) and multiply it by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) term, it's the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion. So, 384 should be the correct answer. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second polynomial has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first times the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term, so perhaps it's considering the entire coefficient, including the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that is, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first times the sum of all coefficients in the second. That makes sense because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64, which is 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a scalar, it must be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check that. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, it would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that would be a polynomial, not a number. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both. So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check this again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a number. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial, but that's a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that seems like it would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, so perhaps the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when you multiply the two expansions, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps the only term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), that would be a term with \\(c^k\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would require \\(c^k\\) to be \\(c^0\\), so that the term is just a scalar multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the \\(c\\) expansion, you get a term that's just a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is what we're interested in. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check again. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, when you expand the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not quite right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that's not the same as the constant term. So, perhaps I confused that earlier. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I consider the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. So, \\((a + b)^4\\): the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\): the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, perhaps the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a scalar multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion would be multiplied by the corresponding term in the first. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is a single term, so when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, you'd get \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would give you a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, let me think again. The entire product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times c^{-n}\\) or something like that, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) factor, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, actually, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which would be the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then yes, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\).

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by this term, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find its sum of coefficients, which is indeed 64, as I thought earlier. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we need to sum over all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that brings us back to 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But the problem didn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), which would be the sum over all coefficients from the \\(c\\) part multiplied by 6. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me compute the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion, each of which has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\) as \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As before, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of coefficients is indeed 64. Let's compute it:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(c = 1\\), this becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider only the term with that \\(k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to sum over all possible \\(k\\), which is why we multiply by the sum of coefficients of the other polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would involve more steps. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the answer is 384.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The expression \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 when \\(c = 1\\).\n\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I think I'm confident with this answer now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Considering \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the sum of all coefficients in this expansion. Setting \\(c = 1\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."
