    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\), because \\(b^k = b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, that gives me the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how that affects the coefficient. Wait, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are separate from the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. So, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would indeed just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that. So, actually, the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is being multiplied by each term, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Therefore, the coefficient remains 6, regardless of the second part. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me check that again. Suppose I have two expressions, one with variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another with variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\). Therefore, any term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m c^{ -n}\\), but the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6. Wait, but that seems too simple. Let me think of a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so their coefficients are independent. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. So, maybe the answer is 6. But I'm a bit unsure because the problem includes both parts, so perhaps I need to consider something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which would include all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all terms from the second part, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but let me check that again. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately. The first expansion has terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., and the second expansion has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5(1/c)\\), \\(c^4(1/c)^2\\), etc. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) (for various \\(k\\)) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second part. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's impossible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms involving \\(c\\), you can't have a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Ah, that makes more sense. So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when expanded. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this as well, but wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\), maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Or does it? Hmm, actually, when multiplying two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a number, but we're looking for a coefficient in terms of variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. In other words, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we'll get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just check if I did everything correctly. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) which is 6. Then, I found the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) which is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part has variables c and 1/c, which are different from a and b.

Or is it more complicated than that?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a and b, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various k. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire sum of coefficients from the second part? Or is that not correct?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms involving c, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting c = 1. So, let me compute that. If c = 1, then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, is the answer 384?\n\nWait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Because in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, each of these products will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of c, perhaps I need to consider that when multiplying the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of c, but since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, the total coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that seems to align with what I thought earlier. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Let me expand both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum over all k from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) multiplied by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the coefficient from the first part is 6, and each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each k. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, the total coefficient is 6 * sum_{k=0}^{6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\).\n\nBut sum_{k=0}^{6} \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to 2^6 = 64, as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can interfere, but in this case, since the second polynomial only involves c, and the first involves a and b, their variables are independent. So, when you multiply, the coefficients just multiply across. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes terms that don't involve a or b, so effectively, each term in the second polynomial is a scalar multiple when considering the product with the first polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of a specific term in P, say \\(a^2b^2\\), would be multiplied by each term in Q, which are terms like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be the coefficient from P times the coefficient from Q for that k. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then effectively, the coefficient is the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients from Q, because each term in Q contributes a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific k, then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on c, it's the sum over all possible k of the coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient from P.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it as the product of the two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is scaled by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first times the sum of coefficients from the second.\n\nSo, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial again. The sum of coefficients is when c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAnd the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64 when \\(c = 1\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant will still be \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, if there's a \\(c\\) term, it would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) times 20 (from the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens at \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That would correspond to the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so in terms of the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\) implies that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I just need the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by something from the other part? Or is it more complicated? Let me think. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me clarify. When we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various exponents \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be part of terms that also have powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on the powers of \\(c\\), and the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find that, I need to take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part, so their product would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero occurs at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \n   The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   \n   To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \n   The general term in the expansion is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   \n   To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let's see, in the expansion, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). What's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\)? That's 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so unless there's some interaction between these variables, maybe I don't need to expand the second part. Hmm, but wait, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider the coefficient from the first part and then consider how the second part contributes. Wait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the product would involve terms where each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since I'm looking for a term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\), that means that the term from the second expansion must be a constant, because if I multiply by any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That way, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I'll get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant, so the coefficient will be 6 times that constant.\n\nSo, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the constant term, we need the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). What's 6 choose 3? That's 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (since the constant term doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts) is 6 * 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when I multiply each of these by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, yes, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and consider the multinomial coefficients, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two separate binomial expansions, and since the variables are separate, the coefficients multiply when you take the product. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, another thought: when you have two separate binomials multiplied together, the coefficients for specific terms multiply if the variables don't interfere. So, in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part only interacts with the constant term in the second part, so their coefficients multiply. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's solid.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right?

So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from the second expression affect that.

So, when you expand it, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are in terms of c. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at the term that doesn't change the a and b exponents, but actually, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in c, you're just getting terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any c terms, would be zero, because all the terms would have c to some power. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering that the other part could contribute a constant term. Wait, let me check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c, but the way it's phrased, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But that can't be, because in the product, each term would be a combination of a, b, and c terms. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in c. That would make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in c. So, that would mean that I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of c is zero. Then, multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. So, let me calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of c to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when I multiply them, the term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), so the coefficient is 20 * 6 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. Alternatively, if I'm just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in c, which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for.

So, when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that means we need to consider all possible terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the two expressions, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. That doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense because then it's a single term. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that they mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make the term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be a number. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking. Let me assume that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I'll need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). That corresponds to when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), since \\(n = 4\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because the problem is asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the second part involves \\(c\\). Wait, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of the second part? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not present in the second part. So, maybe the second part just contributes a factor that is multiplied by the first part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier for the first part. Let me think. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms in the second part. But actually, no, that's not correct either because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the second part must contribute a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), i.e., a constant term. Because if the second part had terms with \\(c\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, but since the original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be that the second part contributes a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it step by step. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 720 / (6 \\times 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part contributes 20 as a constant, so when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as the product of two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expansion, and the second expansion's constant term is 20, the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by something from the second part? Hmm, let me think. Actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since these variables are different and don't interact (they're independent), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply if the terms are being multiplied. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, but \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables. So, when you expand the entire expression, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. For example, a term might be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^3\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times (1/c^2)\\), but in both cases, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient from the second part. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), or specifically \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\)? The problem says: \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Hmm, so maybe it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). So, the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need to find all terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the coefficient from the second part, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), can vary depending on \\(m\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6? Wait, no, because each term in the product is a separate term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But if I multiply 6 by 64, that would give me 384, but that seems too large. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But is that correct? Because each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I need to sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, maybe it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, ignoring the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is the product. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check with a small example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 2 (since \\((c + 1/c)\\) evaluated at c=1 is 2). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it: \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient for \\(b\\) is also 2. So, applying the same logic, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), and then multiply by 6, giving 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treating \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) as a separate part, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both. So, I think the correct approach is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would involve multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of coefficients from the second part. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of this total. However, this approach might not directly help because it sums all coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384, as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, but that seems too simple, and the presence of the second part suggests that it's more involved. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would require considering the entire product, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part up to \\(a^2b^2\\), ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, but that seems incorrect. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Since the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients in the second part), giving 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when I multiply this by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to compute it differently, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).

    "text": " I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? So, that would be when \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which is when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Since \\(n = 4\\), \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this also needs to be expanded, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can just consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a single term. Wait, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the entire expansion of the second part doesn't affect the coefficient we're looking for. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand both, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms from the second expansion, because each term in the first expansion (including \\(a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the term in the product where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it's like multiplying by a constant. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by all of them, the total coefficient would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, first, let me find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (the sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check if I'm doing this correctly. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to some power and \\(c\\) raised to some power. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in the expansion where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, would contribute to the coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can expand both expressions separately and then find the coefficient. Let's try that. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials, and when you look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). 2. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). 3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Now, the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that the coefficient I found, 6, will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the first part is 6. However, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by terms involving \\(c\\), those will affect other terms but not \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that any term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). But that's not possible because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will only produce terms with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. Wait, actually, let me check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) will be 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. So, each term is a coefficient times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the entire product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when multiplied by terms with \\(c\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for various \\(k\\). So, maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the total coefficient when you collect all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd because the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of those, you get \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient times \\(c^{k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply out the entire expression, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6*64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) would only have a coefficient if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), then we need to find the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero in the second expansion. So, that would be when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need the constant term from the second expansion. So, let me confirm this approach. So, in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient there is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). That seems correct because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the product of the coefficients from each part where the variables match. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term in the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(c\\) either, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), we would have to find the corresponding term in the second expansion, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it must be the constant term. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using binomial theorem: coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term (where exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).\n3. For the constant term, solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n4. Coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n5. Multiply the two coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I was overcomplicating it earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, but the problem specifically asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) must be raised to the zero power, so the constant term. So, the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the constant term in the second binomial expansion, which is 20, and multiplying it by the coefficient from the first expansion, which is 6.

So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\) times \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in \\( (a + b)^4 \\) will be multiplied by each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\).

Alternatively, if I multiply by a term with \\(c^k\\), it would change the power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), maybe I don't need to worry about \\(c\\) at all? Wait, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, the coefficients will add up. Let me see. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Wait, is that correct? Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\) is of the form \\( \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But that sum is 6 times the sum of the binomial coefficients, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients for \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to sum all the coefficients, but instead, realize that when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of coefficients in the second expansion).

Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me verify this because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can treat the two parts separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Then, the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded, and each term in this expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). When we multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning \\(c^0\\). In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. So, let me check that approach. So, if I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify the problem statement again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, in the entire expression, terms can have various powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I need to check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), so the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from the first part times the coefficients from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. So, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\). In polynomial expressions, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term that doesn't include another variable, it typically means the sum of all coefficients where that term appears, regardless of the other variables. So, for example, in \\( (x + y)(x + y) \\), the coefficient of \\(x\\) is 2, because \\(x\\) appears in both \\(x^2\\) and \\(xy\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in that case, the coefficient of \\(x\\) would be 2, but in our case, it's different because we have multiple variables. Wait, no, actually, in our problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, they might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, I might be overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by the entire expansion in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But let me verify this with an example. Let's take a smaller exponent to see if the logic holds. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. First, expand \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). Then, expand \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Now, multiply them: (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in this product is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. Alternatively, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2 (since \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2 times the sum of coefficients, which is 2 * 2 = 4, but in the expansion, we have 2abc and 2ab/c, so coefficients are 2 + 2 = 4, which matches. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2, which matches. So, this seems to confirm that the coefficient of a term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is calculated by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(c^0\\), the power of \\(c\\) doesn't change. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, the terms combine by adding exponents. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then from the second part, I need to find the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that term. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20. Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient should be 120. \n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That's correct. Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together, 6 * 20 is 120. That seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\).

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But in this case, the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we're just left with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the second part is being multiplied, so actually, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a scalar multiple when multiplied by the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a term involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part, then actually, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would contribute its coefficient to the product when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, you're effectively distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems a bit off because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a sum of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), each multiplied by their respective coefficients. So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.

Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and the second part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(k\\) is 6 times 64. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be different, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product of terms from each expansion gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if we were looking for a specific term involving \\(c\\), like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), then we would have to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion and multiply it by 6.

So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times some constant.

Wait, no, actually, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\).

So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds a coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\).

So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let's find that.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the first expansion gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second expansion gives me a constant term 20. So, when I multiply these two, I get \\(6 * 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is just the constant term 20. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, I realized that to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply this by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\). This occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, solving for k, \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c, so maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the other part doesn't affect it because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c. Let me check that.\n\nWait, but when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, I get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving c. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without c. That means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply by a term with c, then the resulting term would have c, but since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the c terms must cancel out, i.e., the exponent of c must be zero.\n\nSo, let me first compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found to be 6. Then, I need to compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's focus on that.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for m, \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from the other part is 20, so 6 * 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. I think that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms combine, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the constant term is from the second part, their product gives the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is, the entire expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions. So, any term in the product would be a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first expansion, and since the second expansion's terms involve c, the only way to get a term without c is to take the constant term from the second expansion. So, yes, that's why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem logical, using the binomial theorem correctly for each part, finding the required coefficients, and then multiplying them since the terms are independent in the product.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expression? Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expression is a power of \\(c\\), which is separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're just adding a coefficient for each power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) remains 6, regardless of the second part. But that doesn't seem correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, because each term in the second expression is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high, but let me check.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term (if any) in the second polynomial to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term unless the exponent is zero, which it isn't. So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\), but none of them will be just \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero? That can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider all possible terms where the product of the terms from both expansions gives \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific power of \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems too broad. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem, and it's only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense because the expression is a product involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem wouldn't be asking for it if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I'm not sure if the problem is considering all possible \\(c\\) terms or just the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2c^6 + a^2b^2c^4 + ... + a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is zero because the second expansion doesn't have a \\(c^0\\) term. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) does have a constant term. Let me check that. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent is zero when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's only the term where the second expansion contributes a constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean the coefficient regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, or just the coefficient when considering \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\)? If it's the former, then it's 120. If it's the latter, then it's 384. But I think in algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you're considering the term without any other variables, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and each term from the second part is multiplied by it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, but only if we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). However, if we're only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's referring to the coefficient when considering the entire product, regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, I'm confused now. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the expansion will have terms like \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in the second expansion is \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) as I found earlier. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we just need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part has 64 terms (from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\)), each multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think it's considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion has 64 terms, each with their own coefficients, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\). But if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion, which is 6, and not considering the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes the second part. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the second expansion has a constant term of 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me try to look for similar problems or think about how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired exponent. But in this case, since we're dealing with two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're effectively scaling the coefficient by each term in the second polynomial, and since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the result is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

That means when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficients from each part will multiply together. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate expression, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a series of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), not constants. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only affected by the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that can't be right because the second part is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second part would contribute to different terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't appear in the product unless the second part has a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, if \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term, then that term would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms will have some power of \\(c\\), so they won't be just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a monomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and each term in the other expansion is a monomial in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as expanding both parts separately and then looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, that term would be \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120a^2b^2. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
