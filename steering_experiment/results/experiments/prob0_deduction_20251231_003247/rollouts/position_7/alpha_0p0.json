    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, let me compute that term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). That's the coefficient I need from the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm trying to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire expression would be the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only if the terms multiply in such a way that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that I need to consider all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), still result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe I can just consider the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms will just add their own exponents. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because that would imply that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when asked for a coefficient, you might be looking for a numerical coefficient, not one that's a function of another variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a sum involving powers of \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and I'm not sure if that's what is intended. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^4\\) or something else, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Let me think again. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term would contribute to a different term in the final expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct either because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are not the same as the sum of coefficients. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1, so in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I would get 384 as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. But wait, is that accurate? Let me think carefully. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all together, but as written, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so they are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make more sense, as then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me confirm this by considering the expansion. Let me write out the product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to 4. Each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to 6. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\) will have coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when we multiply these, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left( \\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} \\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient is indeed this polynomial. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then we need to find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Since \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). But the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\), so I'm a bit confused. Let me check the original problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about another approach. If I consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent polynomials, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first and the sum of coefficients in the second. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. So, which one is correct? Let me see. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\) multiplied by that term. So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) all in the same expansion, but as written, they are separate. Let me check the problem again: \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, it's two separate binomials multiplied together. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have coefficients that are multiplied by each term in the second binomial, resulting in different powers of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if they are asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if they are asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) = 6 * 20 = 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as it's more common to ask for a specific term, but since the problem didn't specify, it's a bit ambiguous. However, given the way the problem is written, I think the intended answer is 384, as it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). So, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so each term will have a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term is 6 times the corresponding binomial coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left( \\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 + \\dbinom{6}{1}c^4 + \\dbinom{6}{2}c^2 + \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 + \\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} + \\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} + \\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} \\right)\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is this entire expression. However, if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Alternatively, if they want the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm not sure. However, in most cases, when asked for the coefficient of a term with multiple variables, it's usually considering the term with specific exponents for all variables, so in this case, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. But I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the exponent of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, but the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 384, as it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, to wrap up, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiplying these results gives the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the expression, it's \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the entire second part is? Or do I need to consider the second part as well? Wait, no, because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), that term will be multiplied by the entire sum from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not an expression. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps they mean the coefficient when considering all variables together? But \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be right either. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the coefficient there is 6. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. No, the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Let me double-check this reasoning. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about it as the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only looking for a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a scalar multiple. So, yeah, I think 384 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with c. So, since the expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is a polynomial in c and 1/c, the terms in the second part will affect the overall expression but not the a and b variables. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, if I have (terms in a and b) times (terms in c and 1/c), the a and b parts are independent of c and 1/c.

Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, when we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant (with respect to a and b) and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), because the second part doesn't involve a or b. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2(1/c)^k\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of c. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of c, so when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the c terms just tag along. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you're effectively scaling the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in Q(c), and then adding them all together. So, yes, the sum of the coefficients in Q(c) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by expanding the second part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the terms are:\n\n- When \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\cdot c^6\\)\n- When \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- When \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- When \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- When \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, the sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so plugging in \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Since the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part is in terms of c, which is a different variable, does that affect anything? I don't think so because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficients from each part. Since in the first part, the coefficient is 6, and in the second part, the sum of coefficients is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, for each term in the first polynomial, you multiply by each term in the second, and the coefficients multiply. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of c, I can consider that the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to scaling the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). When I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\) which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k=2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\nSince the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part, we have:\n\\[\n6 \\times 64 = 384\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Got that part down. Now, the original expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to expand that as well, right? Because the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps I should find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to fully expand both expressions. Let me think.\n\nSince I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I can focus on that term and see how it interacts with the other expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the final product. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient by that amount.\n\nBut wait, actually, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is just a scalar multiple, so when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term, each term's coefficient gets multiplied by 6, and then all those terms contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but actually, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the coefficients of each term in the second expansion are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nTherefore, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient by that amount, but the variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't interfere with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the total coefficient will be \\(6\\) times the sum of the binomial coefficients from the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the sum of the binomial coefficients in the second expansion is just the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Because the sum of the binomial coefficients for any \\(n\\) is \\(2^n\\). So, in this case, \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, the second polynomial is not just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the corresponding term in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, and it's being multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are all constants with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will indeed be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I consider the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then when I multiply these out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion and any term in the second expansion. Since the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But since the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second expansion is a separate term, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just scales the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term's coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite accurate. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just adds another term with the same \\(a^2b^2\\) but multiplied by the coefficient from the second polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) more carefully. Using the binomial theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), and the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2m\\). So, the coefficients are:\n\n- \\(m = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(m = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\)\n- \\(m = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\)\n- \\(m = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n- \\(m = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\)\n- \\(m = 5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\)\n- \\(m = 6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the sum of these coefficients is \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), which confirms that the sum is indeed \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), all those contributions add up. Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum up to \\(64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key insight was recognizing that since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. That makes sense because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), just scales the coefficient, and since we're summing over all terms, it's equivalent to multiplying by the sum of the coefficients.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm confident that the coefficient is \\(384\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the binomial coefficients for \\(n = 6\\) is:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression also has the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider that as well. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to multiply the two expansions together? But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the product of the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, does that mean that any term from the second expansion will just multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficients involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the coefficients involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can consider that each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by all the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of the two expansions. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, let me figure out which term that is. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I need \\(a^2b^2\\), so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving for \\(k\\), \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. However, I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part of the product, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, when I multiply the two expressions together, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) will come from the second part. \n\nSo, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, no, actually, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute its own coefficient, and all these will add up to the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial? I remember that the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial with terms involving various powers of \\(c\\). However, when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second part will result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think my reasoning is correct. Because when you expand the entire expression, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the coefficient from the second part, and since the second part's coefficients sum to 64, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The first expansion gives me terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second gives me terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Let me think about the structure of the problem again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier, and the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times the coefficient from the first part. But since the coefficient from the first part is constant (6) for each term, it's just 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all \\(m\\). \n\nThe sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm not overcomplicating this. Another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, every term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts separately and then multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nI think that's correct. So, I can be confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \n   The binomial theorem states that \\((a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\dbinom{n}{k} a^{n - k}b^k\\).\n\n   For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   \n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \n   The sum of the coefficients in this expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   \n   Since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6 and the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is:\n   \n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to consider the second part? Hmm, maybe not. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so their coefficients shouldn't interfere with each other. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the second part. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means the coefficient won't change because the other part of the product doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should double-check. Let's consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients can combine in different ways. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part of the product only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), there's no way for the terms involving \\(c\\) to affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient should indeed remain 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the overall coefficient remains 6. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply term by term. So, if I have \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by, say, \\( \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so any term from the second expansion would just be a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing things. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would still mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient is being considered in the context of all variables. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, k = 2. Now, for the \\(c\\) part, it can be any exponent, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 from the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which sums up to 64. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, giving 6. Then, for each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, when you multiply 6 by 64, you get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was just 6, but now I'm getting 384. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. That means we're considering all possible terms in the expansion where the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, and we're summing over all the coefficients from the second part. So, each term in the first part that is \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nLet me confirm this with an example. Suppose we have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we have \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) * (c + 1/c) + 2ab * (c + 1/c) + 1 (from \\(b^2\\)) * (c + 1/c). Wait, but in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present because the first part only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second part, which is degree 0 in c, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc., but \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't actually present because you can't get \\(b^2\\) from the first part multiplied by anything from the second part. Wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier approach. \n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing the variables. Let me take another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64. \n\nTherefore, I think my initial approach was correct, and the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, since the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, and we need to find the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and maybe \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are raised to some powers, but the question only specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because if we have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^k \\times (1/c)^k\\), which is \\(c^0\\), then that term would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that logic. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., up to \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120, because it's 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Let me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded, which is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We are interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) or \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Specifically, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (6) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part (20):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check: if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). Perfect, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, does that mean I can ignore the second part? Let me think. The entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expansion of the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate terms, their exponents don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient isn't just 6, because it's multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a single term, not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I need to clarify: when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression is a single term, and when multiplied by each term in the second expression, it would create multiple terms in the product. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think it's just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a constant. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't give a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the part with \\(c\\) is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is separate. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product. Wait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then it's a specific term. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That seems plausible. So, let me try that approach. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) part; it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I was overcomplicating it by considering \\(c\\). Maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the rest is just part of the expression. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the part with \\(c\\) is separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression is the product of both parts. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I need to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), these become \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20. But wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20. But that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no, actually, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But no, that's not right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that can't be, because the second expansion isn't a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part, which is 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, so the coefficient is 6, and the rest is separate. But given that the problem includes both parts, I think the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in the second expansion. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting 120, assuming that the \\(c\\) part is to be considered as well. Alternatively, if it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the answer would be 6, but that seems unlikely. Given that the problem includes both parts, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients combine. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expressions. So, since the first expression has \\(a^2b^2\\) and the second expression has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're considering that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, and any other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6. But wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient should just be 6, because the second part doesn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second expression might contribute a scalar factor. So, maybe the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial contributes a scalar multiple, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. But that can't be right because the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be when \\(c=1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But that seems like a big number, and I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the coefficient times something else. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the entire second expression, the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, and the rest is part of the other terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering that each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible \\(c^k\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.

The second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the powers of \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\), and that way when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nI've already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Therefore, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the expansion, when \\(4 - k = 2\\), that means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that part as well. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the second part because it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Hmm, let me think. The entire expression is the product of two parts: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I just need to consider the coefficient from the first part and ignore the second part because it doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, does that mean we have to consider all possible terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term in the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are multiplied by all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is a bit more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct either because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's expecting a numerical coefficient, but that would require that the \\(c\\) terms also form a specific term, which isn't specified. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, and we're looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and then considering the \\(c\\) terms as part of the coefficient. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by the corresponding coefficient from the \\(c\\) part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and finding the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would still be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems contradictory because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, we can treat the entire second factor as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the second factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to look at similar problems. In general, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms from each expression whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But since the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first expression, and then multiplied by any term from the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire second expression. So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense if we're just looking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire second expansion. But that seems odd because usually, when asked for a coefficient, it's with respect to specific variables. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would require considering the product in terms of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient as a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would still be 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is also a factor. Wait, but no, because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that's not correct either because the coefficients in the second part are not all added together; instead, each term is multiplied by the corresponding term in the first part. Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, which would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). For example, the term \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second expansion. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) would have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), or it could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). If it's the former, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. If it's the latter, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is 6 times the entire second expansion. Since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, let's proceed under that assumption. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and considering that the second part can contribute any power of \\(c\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power, then perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense in this context. So, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " That would give me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\). But I specifically need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well.

However, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which involves \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But since the original problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think I might have misunderstood. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is a product of two expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a standalone term, and when multiplied by terms from the second expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion would multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would accumulate all the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the product is a combination of a term from each expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient from the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because for each term in the second expansion, you're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion multiplied by a term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, I need to find the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would result in a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k=3\\) is the constant term, and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the first part: \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The second part: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs at \\(k=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).

So, when I multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the variables are different, the only way the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term with \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in other words, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nSo, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. That would be \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that will give me \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the variables in the first part. So, I need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of 20. Now, going back to the original expression, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when we expand both and multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term (with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these are the only terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied together, their coefficients multiply, giving 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " That means the expansion will have terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by their respective binomial coefficients. Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. Let me see, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions. Wait, but actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think the coefficient will just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But in this case, the first polynomial's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a single term, and the second polynomial is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only considering the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), the only way that happens is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which would come from the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's work on that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Therefore, the constant term is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just double-check that. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

But wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product would be a combination of an \\(a\\) term and a \\(c\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when I multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all possible terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and multiply them by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6, and then sum them up. Wait, but that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. However, in this case, the specific term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and in the second polynomial \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), every term is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need to find the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. But let me make sure by another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms will be multiplied by 6, giving 6c^6, 36c^4, 90c^2, 120, 90c^{-2}, 36c^{-4}, 6c^{-6}. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by each of the coefficients in the second polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these coefficients. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's simpler to think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nSo, let me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. \n\nOkay, so let's work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nLet me double-check that reasoning. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, because the problem might be considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), so each term is a product of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by a term that has \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Otherwise, you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait, but let me think again: Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)? Because if it's the former, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's the latter, meaning the coefficient when considering all variables, so it's 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, but that would be different. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) would actually be zero because there's no term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(c\\) terms are separate. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials. The first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is 120. So, I think that's the correct interpretation. \n\nTo confirm, let me think about how the terms combine. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\), and each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is of the form \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\). So, when you multiply them, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, it must be referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check my binomial coefficients again to make sure I didn't make a mistake there. \n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), which is correct. \n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct. \n\nSo, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. \n\nI think that's the correct answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would correspond to when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(k = 2\\) for \\(b\\). So, solving \\(4 - k = 2\\) gives \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because that would give terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can appear in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and 1 from the second part, but actually, no, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), but none of them are constants unless the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Wait, so maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're looking for. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), and then sum up their coefficients. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when we set \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that might not be correct because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\). So, yes, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then we would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach too. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the expansion, each term would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m \\). So, the term would be \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). We need to find all terms where \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\). That is, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. But wait, earlier I thought maybe it was 120 if considering only the constant term. So, which is it? Let me check the problem statement again: it just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire expansion, every term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, each contributing their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the answer should be 384. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, it's ambiguous. But in most cases, when asked for the coefficient of a term involving multiple variables, it's considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, perhaps 384 is the correct answer. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, making it a constant term, so the coefficient would be 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Since the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 384. So, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has a total sum of coefficients equal to 64, the overall coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me double-check this approach. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). The product P(a, b) * Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as the coefficient in P(a, b) times Q(c), which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), because each term in Q(c) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. Therefore, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be different. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in Q(c), which is 20, and then multiply by 6 to get 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be. Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). Now, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in this product, the terms are \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. But according to my previous reasoning, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\) is 2, so the total coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. But in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong. So, where did I go wrong? I think the mistake is that in the product, the term \\(a^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't have a \\(b\\) term, the product doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero, which contradicts my earlier approach. Therefore, my initial approach was incorrect. So, I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in the simple case I just considered, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches because the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, in that case, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2\\), you get \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, but it's multiplied by terms from the second polynomial, which don't have \\(b\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), so when we take \\(a^2b^2\\) from that, and multiply by any term from the second polynomial, which is in \\(c\\), the resulting terms will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless \\(k = 0\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term; it's not multiplied by \\(c^k\\), but rather, the product will have terms that are products of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributing their coefficients. So, in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial. Wait, but in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, but according to my earlier approach, it would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is wrong. So, my approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. Let me think again. In the original problem, we have two separate variables: \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times each term in the second expansion, but that's not possible because the variables are separate. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial, so the product cannot have \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(b\\) is present in the second polynomial. Wait, but in the original problem, the second polynomial is only in \\(c\\), so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is zero because there's no constant term in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial, so the product cannot have \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, my approach must be incorrect because in that case, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Therefore, my initial reasoning was wrong. So, what's the correct approach?\n\nI think the confusion arises because the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent. So, when you multiply two polynomials in different variables, the coefficients don't combine in the way I thought. Instead, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), not in \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that makes more sense. So, in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial, but actually, the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is zero because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present. Wait, no, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), so there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But in the simple case, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, I'm still confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the second polynomial, but that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a scalar. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero, which matches because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is zero, and 0 times the second polynomial is zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, so the coefficient in the product would be 6 times the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the second polynomial. But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), so if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is 384. But I'm still unsure because in the simple case, the approach gave the wrong result. Wait, in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the second polynomial, but according to the approach, it's 1 (coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial) times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, giving 2, which is wrong. Therefore, the approach must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of any term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is only possible if the second polynomial has a constant term. So, in the simple case, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. In the original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, which is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the answer is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, in the simple case, since the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which is correct. In the original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, the answer is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is found when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Let me write that down: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion. Because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part won't change, right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up when the variables match. But in this case, the variables are different. The first part has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), while the second part has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, their exponents won't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when multiplied by any term from the second part, the \\(a^2b^2\\) part remains, but the \\(c\\) terms just tag along. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me check another approach. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficients multiply if the variables don't interfere. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion will contribute a coefficient to the product, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in all of them, the total coefficient is \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but I feel like this might not be correct because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's just asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\)'s power. So, the answer should be 384. Let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two separate expansions. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, they all add up to the total coefficient. So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Let me compute that: \\(1 + 6 = 7\\), \\(7 +15=22\\), \\(22 +20=42\\), \\(42 +15=57\\), \\(57 +6=63\\), \\(63 +1=64\\).

That means I need to consider the entire product. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means I'm only interested in the part where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't change it, but just contributes a coefficient. So, essentially, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the coefficient of the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by that constant term, I just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, which is what we're looking for.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nI need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I set the exponent equal to zero: \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives me 6 as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives me 20 as the coefficient for the constant term. Multiplying them together, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part's expansion doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient remains 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficients. But since we're only interested in the term where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out (i.e., the constant term), that's where the 20 comes in. So, yes, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The binomial coefficients seem right, and the exponents for \\(c\\) were calculated correctly.
