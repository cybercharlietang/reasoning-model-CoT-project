    "text": " So, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). \n\nSince the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(k = 2\\) in the binomial expansion, right? Because the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) would be \\(2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider this part as well because when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will combine. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, maybe I don't need to expand the second part because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nLet me think about that. So, the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when I multiply them, the terms will not interfere with each other. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a term that's in terms of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when I multiply the two expansions, every term from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I need to see if there's a term in the second expansion that is a constant, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I multiply by a term involving \\(c\\), the resulting term would have \\(c\\) in it, which is not what we're looking for. \n\nSo, that means I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times a constant. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me verify that. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) expanded as \\(6a^2b^2 + \\text{other terms}\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expanded as, say, \\(k c^0 + \\text{other terms}\\), then when I multiply them together, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times k c^0\\) will be \\(6k a^2b^2\\), which is the term I'm interested in. So, yes, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. \n\nNow, let me figure out the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the exponent to be 0 because that's the constant term. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. \n\nNow, let's compute the coefficient for that term. It's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again. \n\nActually, \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{(6)(6)} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20 \\times 6 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nJust to double-check, let me think about whether there are any other terms that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second expansion only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and any other terms from the second expansion would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have those variables, which we don't want. So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the expansion would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nOkay, so in this expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the problem is not just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that's interesting because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Let me think about that.\n\nSo, when I multiply two expressions together, the terms combine by multiplying each term from the first expression by each term from the second expression. So, in this case, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the product of any term from the first expansion and any term from the second expansion will have variables that are products of these different variables. So, for example, a term like \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion multiplied by \\(c^6\\) from the second expansion would give \\(a^4c^6\\), and so on.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Now, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so that means we're looking for the term in the product where the variables from the second expansion multiply to 1, effectively not changing the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that possible? Because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are variables, unless their exponents cancel out, they would contribute to the variables in the term.\n\nWait, but if we're looking for a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by some term from the second expansion, the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But for that something to be 1, the term from the second expansion must be 1, right? Because otherwise, we'd have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), which would make the term have variables \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, which isn't the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from the second expansion is 1. But does \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) have a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero)?\n\nLet me check that. Let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. The binomial theorem tells us that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that would give us a constant term. So, we set the exponent equal to zero:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(m\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2m \\implies m = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. Let's compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. That means when we multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by this constant term from the second expansion, we get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first expansion gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion has a constant term 20, so when we multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the entire product as a product of two polynomials and look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but since \\(c\\) terms are separate, but the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require the \\(c\\) terms to multiply to 1. So, yes, that's why we needed the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, which confirms the earlier result.\n\nLet me also consider whether there are other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). For example, if there were terms in the second expansion with negative exponents that could cancel out exponents from the first expansion, but in this case, the first expansion only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so their exponents don't involve \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, I think that's the only contribution. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. And for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120, yes.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. That would be when \\(n - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(n = 4\\), \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, does the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, because when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains the same? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by another expression, say \\(E\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expression \\(E\\). But since \\(E\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when I multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just \\(a^2b^2 \\times E\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving powers of \\(c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not quite right because the coefficient is a numerical factor, and when you multiply by another expression, it's more about combining the terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part of the product is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just the expansion, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables here. Let me clarify: the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by the entire expression in \\(c\\), it's just 6 times that expression. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written is just \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that might be an issue. Wait, looking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire product, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and then the coefficient would be the sum of all those coefficients. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in that expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to a sum of terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2/c^2\\), etc. Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) would just be 6 * 20, because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Wait, that makes more sense. Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) factors is when you multiply by the constant term, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, which one is correct? Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But if we're only considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term, then the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. But if we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which typically means the coefficient regardless of the other variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product with \\(c\\) terms, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in standard algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product, it usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables. But in this case, since the product includes \\(c\\), it's a bit tricky. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I think in the context of the problem, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120. Let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Then, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6*6=36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6*15=90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*20=120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 6*15=90, and so on. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 120. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's 120. However, if the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it might mean the coefficient when considering all variables, but in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a product with \\(c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but I'll proceed with the assumption that it's 120. Wait, but let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that's if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). However, in standard polynomial terms, the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically refer to the term where the variables are exactly \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the powers of \\(c\\) are zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think the confusion arises because the problem includes both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is just 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me double-check that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) of 20. Therefore, when multiplying, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Yes, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the expansion will have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be the term where \\(k = 2\\), because then \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly looking for a term in this part, but since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part, maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, I might not need to consider the second part at all, or maybe I need to consider the entire expansion. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the second part is multiplied by the first part, so every term in the first part gets multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, but wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, but that's not right because the second part is a separate variable. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWhen you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion is the product of the two expansions. So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^5\\) is another term, and so on. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that's not correct because the second part isn't a scalar; it's a polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has multiple terms. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part's \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in that expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term equal to its coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the expansion, every term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all m of the coefficients from the second part. So, yes, that's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a polynomial, when you multiply, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Another way to think about it is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're considering all possible terms, it's the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that's 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion step by step. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) as before. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where m ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), it contributes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all these contributions. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6.\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), because the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given n is \\(2^n\\). So, that's 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering that the variables \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a scalar. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's not exactly accurate because each term in the second expansion is a separate term. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's effectively 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and see, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. So, that confirms that the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this approach is correct. Because when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is a polynomial that, when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's as if we're multiplying 6 by the entire second polynomial, but since the second polynomial's coefficients sum to 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives the final coefficient: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, I think I need to consider the entire expression. But how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe the other part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\).

So, that means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied, and since they involve different variables, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit off because the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), if we set \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's exactly what I thought before. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two separate polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you're effectively scaling that 6 by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). And since the sum of coefficients is 64, as I calculated before, then 6 times 64 is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, implying that it's a constant. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that approach. If I have two polynomials, say P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) multiplied by Q(c) would indeed be the coefficient in P(a, b) times the sum of coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, so the coefficient of a specific term in P is scaled by the entire sum of Q's coefficients. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions being equal to the product of their individual expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(b\\). So, that seems to check out. So, scaling by the sum of coefficients works in that case.\n\nTherefore, I think my approach is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and see if the sum of its coefficients is indeed 64. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so plugging \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought before. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that's the same as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think I've gone through this from multiple angles, and each time I arrive at the same conclusion. So, I'm pretty confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make absolutely sure, let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times (c + 1/c), so 2 * 2 = 4. And the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 (the coefficient in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2 (the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\)). So, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given problem is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in this reasoning now. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Hmm, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Let me think about that. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, when I multiply the two expansions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would multiply. However, since we're looking for a specific term in the product, maybe I need to consider how the terms combine. Wait, no, actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\), which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. \n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but that seems off. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, I get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first sum is multiplied by each term from the second sum. So, the general term in the product would be:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nBut since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way a term can have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\), and then the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's a separate variable. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all possible exponents of \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 * 64 = 384? That seems high. \n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, which could be \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion, each of which has a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But as I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me check that again. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all coefficients is indeed \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by 64, I get 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a numerical coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that seems too simple. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That would require me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. \n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial expansion again. \n\nSo, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a numerical value. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all variables, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the expression, so the coefficient would include all possible terms from the \\(c\\) part. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a number, so that can't be it. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that's a polynomial, not a number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. \n\nBut that seems too simple, and the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so perhaps the answer is more involved. Maybe I need to consider that when multiplying the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me verify this. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when \\(c = 1\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, maybe that's the answer. \n\nWait, but if I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems to make sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). However, considering that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the only way that makes sense is that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which when evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6 because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic, especially since the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\) or something else, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, given that, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expansion of the second part is multiplied by that, so the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of the second part.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the final coefficient:**\n   Multiply the coefficients from both parts: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nNow, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), that term would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because if \\(k = 2\\), then the exponent of \\(a\\) would be \\(4 - 2 = 2\\) and the exponent of \\(b\\) would be \\(2\\). So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which I think is 6. Let me check: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here because the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nHmm, so when I multiply two expressions together, the terms get multiplied term by term. So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to figure out if any of the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. \n\nWait a second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and when I multiply it by the other expression, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), those terms will only affect the powers of \\(c\\) in the resulting expression.

When I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the result will be 6\\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, each of which is a power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems too straightforward. But let me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to stay as \\(a^2b^2\\), but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me check the problem again: it says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the product with coefficients multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of 0, so that the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would accumulate all those terms. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\).\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, going back, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, so that makes more sense. So, the problem was probably asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. But just to be sure, let me check the problem statement again. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, does that mean that it's considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut that seems conflicting with the earlier approach where I considered \\(c^0\\). So, which one is correct? Let me think about it. If the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the product, each term is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by any term from the second expansion, it would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can be from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). \n\nBut wait, no, that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient of a specific term is the numerical factor in front of that term. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's looking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, for each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of each term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, that seems a bit abstract. Let me try to think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come only from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this. \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them together: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\)), but wait, no, that's not right. Actually, each term is separate. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), so the coefficient is 1*(c + 1/c). But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^0\\), that would be zero because there's no \\(c^0\\) term in \\(a^2\\). Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me go back. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product with coefficients equal to the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term in the product is a combination, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're considering all terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example I tried earlier, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1*(c + 1/c), but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1 + 1 = 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1*(sum of coefficients in second expansion). \n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, in my earlier smaller example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, which is correct. So, yes, that seems to be the right approach. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. \n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it might be 120 if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, which is it? I think the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, it's 384. \n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. The first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), gives terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion comes with a coefficient of 6. When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the total coefficient for each \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients for all \\(k\\), which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nSince the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. Since the exponents add up to 4, that's correct. So, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because in the expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the product, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think. If I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and then multiply it by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) and some power of \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the product that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^3\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^3\\), which is a different term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1, you just get the same term. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen you have two separate products, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a, b\\) are entirely separate from \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that can't be because the coefficient would then be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, which would make it not a single coefficient but a sum involving coefficients of different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, we're looking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first part). \n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) and a power of \\(c\\). When we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) is 6 * \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients where the power of \\(c\\) is anything? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion times 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. If I have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), then when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is a sum over all powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in a term \\(a^2b^2c^{k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion times 6. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all the terms in the other polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but all having \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to multiply the coefficients from both expansions where the exponents match. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part, summed over all possible terms in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion times the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's the coefficient in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nNow, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the resulting terms will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I thought earlier. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it differently, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and any exponents of \\(c\\) are allowed. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   The sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of the coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop there. I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, so maybe I should expand both parts separately and then see how the terms combine.\n\nLet me denote the first part as \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and the second part as \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can think about how the terms in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) multiply together. Specifically, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will multiply each term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when multiplied by \\(B\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times B\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), but since \\(B\\) doesn't contain \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) is separate. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in \\(B\\), the product \\(a^2b^2 \\times B\\) will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies depending on the term in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, wait, that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(A \\times B\\) is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the entire sum of coefficients in \\(B\\), but that can't be right because when you multiply, you're actually combining the terms. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, when multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{k-1}\\), etc., depending on the term in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it. So, unless there's a term in \\(B\\) that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), then \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by that constant term would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\), because only then will the product term be \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me compute that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) \u21d2 \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(B\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\(A \\times B\\) is the product of the coefficients from \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\(A = (a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(B = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are being multiplied, each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), but only the term in \\(B\\) that's a constant will contribute to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. All other terms in \\(B\\) will introduce some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term in \\(B\\) will multiply with \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term without \\(c\\), which is what we're looking for. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear. The coefficient is 6.\n\nBut wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the first part, and then we have another part involving \\(c\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term would just be multiplied by whatever the constant term is in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the terms multiply together. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and a term from the second part, say \\(c^k \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^{6 - k}\\), then the product would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{k - (6 - k)}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^2b^2c^{2k - 6}\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but the second part might have a term that is a constant, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that term would be \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, if I can find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which has a coefficient of 6, I would get the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, that makes sense. Therefore, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. Let me write that out. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent on \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me compute that again. \\(6! = 720\\), \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part has a coefficient of 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the total coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Is there any chance I made a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients? Let me check \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) again: 4 choose 2 is indeed 6. And 6 choose 3 is 20, which is correct because 6*5*4/(3*2*1) = 20. So, yes, that's right. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the problem differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I can consider that any term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's only the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since we're just considering the coefficient, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is specific to a power of \\(c\\). So, maybe that approach is more complicated.\n\nI think my initial approach is correct: since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term independent of \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me think about the entire expansion. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion. Wait, but that's not quite right either because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be incorrect because each term in the second expansion is specific to a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, I think I might have misinterpreted the problem initially. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, to get a term without \\(c\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to consider the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we need to find the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's solid.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I've dealt with the first part, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I guess I need to figure out how that part affects the coefficient. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the expansion? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by a constant, it just scales the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion gets multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\).

I need to find the term where the exponent is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).

So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms multiply. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first expansion is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will become \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, does that mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Hmm, that might be a way to think about it, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). Wait, actually, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve summing over all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part will contribute to multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by some coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check this reasoning because sometimes when you have variables, you have to consider how the exponents affect the terms. But in this case, since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think this approach is correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which contributes a coefficient. So, the total contribution is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat the second polynomial as a scalar when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). So, in the entire product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the same as if we set \\(c = 1\\) in the second polynomial, which gives us the sum of all coefficients, as I did earlier. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to confirm. Let me expand both parts separately and see how the multiplication works. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\) is equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I calculated before. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that confirms it again.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the sum of coefficients, I could have considered that when you have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, the coefficient would just be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since we're summing over all possible terms, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, giving 384. So, I'm confident that 384 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) another way. The sum of the coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), as I did before, which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Alternatively, I can compute it by expanding the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will occur when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. So, if I let \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these two parts are multiplied together, and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be separate from those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a separate variable from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times something. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product should be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is actually 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6\\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when variables are involved, the terms might not combine as I thought. Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied as a constant. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me approach this differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and its coefficient is 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate, the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nSo, to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second sum, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire expression is the product of two sums. When we multiply these two sums together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the coefficient from the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second sum. Wait, but the second sum has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when we multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second sum, each of those terms will have their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAs before, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6.

So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, or do I have to consider the other part as well? \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers, and I need to find the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\).

Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, for example, if I have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), it's \\(ac + ad + bc + bd\\). So, in this case, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by something involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but we just want \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. If I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is just multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q(c)\\). But in this case, \\(Q(c)\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms. So, when you multiply \\(P(a, b)\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), I think the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\). \n\nWait, but actually, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times something with \\(c\\), that term would have \\(c\\) in it, so it wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), ignoring the other part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. \n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is considered as a term in the entire expression, which would include \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so in order to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part by the term in the second part that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTherefore, I think I need to compute two things: \n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier.\n2. The constant term (i.e., the coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nThen, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by that constant term. \n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step. \n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct. \n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting the exponent equal to 0, we get \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct. \n\nTherefore, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), which we found to be 20. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be the same as 120. But since the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, so the answer is 120. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's another way to approach this problem to confirm. \n\nAnother approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can consider that each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and 4, and 0 and 6 respectively. But wait, actually, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(k\\) would go from 0 to 4, and in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), \\(m\\) would go from 0 to 6. \n\nBut since we're looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\), so in the first part, \\(4 - k = 2\\) implies \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\nIn the second part, to get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero. So, as before, in the second part, the exponent is \\(6 - 2m\\), so setting that equal to zero, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's consistent with what I found earlier. So, I feel confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\nJust to make sure, let me try expanding a small part of the expression to see if this makes sense. \n\nFor example, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, the constant term is 20, as we found earlier. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'll go with 120 as the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(a^{2}b^{2}\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. Hmm, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean that the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? Let me think. Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), when I multiply out the two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms will only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(c\\) terms will come from the second part. So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, because the \\(c\\) terms won't interfere with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, is that correct? Or do I need to consider how the two expansions interact?\n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how that term is affected when multiplied by the second expansion. But hold on, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result would be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), where \\(k\\) varies from 0 to 6. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we need to find the part of the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, and thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. So, the overall coefficient will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients we found from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). Let me compute that: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving a total coefficient of 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when you're looking for terms that don't involve the other variables. So, yeah, that makes sense. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is also found using the binomial theorem, which gives 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

That is, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. Let's expand it: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, we have \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\) which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\).

Wait, no, actually, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply 6 by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.

So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to find the term where in the expansion, the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), and then find the coefficient of that.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, I need to compute two things: first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two together to get the final coefficient.\n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, then the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me just confirm that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in a term \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm supposed to consider other terms? For example, if I don't restrict the exponent of \\(c\\) to 0, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but then the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider only the constant term in the second expansion, leading to the coefficient being 120.\n\nWait, let me check my work again. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that we're looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try to see if that makes sense. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting just the coefficient when \\(c^0\\) is considered, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased differently, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include all powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire expansion. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by the binomial coefficients. Similarly, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each multiplied by their binomial coefficients. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but then the coefficient would indeed be a polynomial. However, the problem is phrased as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a number, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes both parts multiplied together.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're considering the product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\). So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), and we're looking for the coefficient where \\(k=2\\) and \\(l=2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which again doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But if I instead consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be zero because there's no such term. Wait, but in this case, the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) at all. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me just go back to the original problem. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the coefficient remains 6. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both factors multiplied together.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second factor, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because the exponent on \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), and the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the entire product. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times whatever is in front of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, I think that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the other part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, perhaps I need to consider how the other terms might combine. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if the other factor contributes a term that's \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the other expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6! / (3!3!) is 720 / (6 * 6) = 720 / 36 = 20. So, yes, the constant term is 20.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any terms involving \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the \\(c\\) part is 1, which is the constant term. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two independent expansions, so when you multiply them, the coefficients multiply as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way that \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear with a different coefficient. For example, if there were terms with \\(c\\) that somehow canceled out, but in this case, since we're only considering \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, the only contribution comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, I think 120 is correct.\n\nSo, in summary, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving the coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe are looking for the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0).

    "text": " \n\nWait, but I only need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared would be when \\(k = 2\\), right? Because the exponent on \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), so if I set \\(k = 2\\), then the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. However, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I need to consider how this term interacts with the second part. \n\nWait, but hold on. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term I'm looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, that would mean that in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the second part contributes a term that's just 1, because \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1 would still be \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but is that possible? Let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded using the binomial theorem would have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the only term that's a constant (i.e., without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is the middle term, which is 20. Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). To get a constant term, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which means \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). \n\nSo, putting it all together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and it's multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6, and the second part gives me a constant term of 20. So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding this product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to pick the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by the term that is 1 (the constant term) from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nIs there any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? For example, could there be a term in the second expansion that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) still gives \\(a^2b^2\\)? No, because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, so multiplying by them would introduce terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which aren't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion. \n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{4 - 2}b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nThus, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nMultiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part gives:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would correspond to when \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is equal to \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I only need the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it's only about \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, there are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, that can't be right because the second part does involve \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as calculated before. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you multiply it by the first part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of the coefficients from all the terms in the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number, which contradicts the problem statement. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part. But that would make the coefficient 6, which seems too simple. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the product would be a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all those products. But that's not quite right because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be present in all those products, each with their own coefficient. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think differently. When you have two independent expansions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one expansion is multiplied by the entire other expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as calculated before, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. But let me verify this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible combinations where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, multiplied by the corresponding terms from the second expansion. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the answer is simply 6, because the problem is only asking about the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simple. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would require considering all possible ways \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed, but since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way is through the first part, so the coefficient is 6. Therefore, the answer is 6. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients equal to the coefficients from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the answer is 384. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the second part of the expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor that, when summed over all terms, equals \\(2^6 = 64\\), the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."
