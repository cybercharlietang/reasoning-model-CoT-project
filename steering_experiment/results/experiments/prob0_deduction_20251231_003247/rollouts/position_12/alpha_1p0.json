    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so does that mean the coefficient is just 6? Hmm, maybe. But wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem wants the coefficient in the entire expansion, considering both parts. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, it's just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part, and then it's multiplied by every term in the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply by the entire second part, it becomes 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would still be 6, because it's multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but considering all terms, so that the coefficient would actually involve terms from the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that sum to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. Wait, that seems possible. Let me think: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to a sum of terms, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(sum of all terms in } \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. But wait, let me confirm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand the entire expression, you get terms involving both \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify whether it wants the coefficient considering all terms or just the part from \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

But actually, no, the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is part of the product. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's a single term \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression has other variables, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps when they're asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they just want the coefficient, regardless of the other variables. But that can't be right because the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a sum over all the terms in the second expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the other variables. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is a product of two parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are present, the product will have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire second part, which doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that's not correct because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the sum of all coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), which would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes 64, and the first part's coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the other variables, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by it. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to calculate the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), the second part becomes \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the total expression is a product, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, so its coefficient is just 6 times whatever comes from the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is considering the entire product, and looking for terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed be 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is the middle term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and find the coefficient of the monomial \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 384 because each term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, so the total coefficient is 6 * sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about it again. If the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, then since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because the coefficient is a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that for each term in the first expansion, you multiply by all terms in the second expansion, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering that the product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that's not possible because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), right? So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. Wait, but the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms in \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and when expanded, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the expansion, we can have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), and the coefficient would be the sum of all such coefficients. Wait, but that might not be the case because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But that seems a bit odd because the problem might just be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which might not be what is intended. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the expansion. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Let me check that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if we're considering the entire expression, does that mean we're looking for all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\)? That would mean that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would give a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but only considering the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and that doesn't make sense as a single coefficient. So, maybe I was correct the first time, that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Let me think again. When you have two separate variables, \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\), the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^mc^{6 - m}\\) or something like that. Wait, no, actually, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the terms in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we need the terms where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k = a^2b^2\\), which implies \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we also have a factor from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too big, and I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that for each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the corresponding coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which we found earlier as 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), meaning \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense, so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too high, and I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\). So, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a^k b^{4 - k}\\) and \\(c^m (1/c)^n\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be paired with every possible term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, to make sure, let me consider an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab \\times c\\), etc., but no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) from the first expansion, which isn't possible because \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because you'd need to multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), which isn't possible here. Wait, no, in the example I gave, \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) in this product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in our original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6a^2b^2, and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), each term in 6a^2b^2 is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times that expansion, which is a polynomial. But that seems unlikely. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. Therefore, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). Let me denote \\( (a + b)^4 = A \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 = B \\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). Now, \\(A\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(B\\) has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15/c^2, 6/c^4, 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., down to \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), is 120. So, I think that's the answer the problem is looking for.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, if I were to expand the entire expression, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^m\\) for various \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I think this interpretation is incorrect because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\), which would require treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a single number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20.\n3. Multiply them together: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables.

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient, not a product. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean 6 times the sum of all coefficients in that expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6\\), since each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, but when you sum all the coefficients, you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems too high. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((a + b)^4\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire expansion as two separate parts: \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j}(1/c)^j = \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\). Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first sum is multiplied by each term in the second sum. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first sum, which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second sum, because when you multiply 6 by each term in the second sum, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, is that accurate? Because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a number but an expression. So, that can't be right. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.

That is, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some expression involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean I only need the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then the entire second part is just 1? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. No, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), it won't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) part; it will just add some \\(c\\) terms. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you just get \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for that term is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) will be the constant term. The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by the constant term) is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and I think that term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) might affect the coefficient, but actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a separate part. But wait, actually, no. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so each term in the second expansion will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would make the coefficient very large, and I don't think that's the case. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is only about the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because when you multiply by the other expression, it's just a scalar multiple. Wait, no, that can't be right either because the other expression is not a scalar; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which is a different term. Similarly, multiplying by \\(c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\) would give \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) part, regardless of the \\(c\\) part. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in effect, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, looking back, the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the constant term. That seems more plausible. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that approach. First, let's find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's actually the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But wait, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 120. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). In the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives the coefficient 6. Now, when we multiply this by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that would give 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's considering the coefficient as a polynomial in \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. But the problem asks for the coefficient, which is usually a number. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a scalar multiple, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, which would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. I think I need to clarify this. In standard terminology, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, they usually mean the coefficient of that term in the expanded form, considering all possible cross terms. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given. Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in other words, it's treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That seems more plausible. So, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiply it by 6, giving 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me confirm this by expanding both parts:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with exponents from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. The constant term is when the exponent is 0, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would have a coefficient of \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're looking for just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Now, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I don't consider the sum of coefficients. Maybe I should consider that each term in the product will have a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Let me confirm by another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will only affect the power of \\(c\\), not \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other factor is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the expansion is a sum of terms, not a single number. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve the other variables is just the product of the coefficients. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are being multiplied together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each term in the product will have a factor from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a factor from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 + 1 = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, if I expand \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the terms would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product is indeed 2, which is 1 (from \\(a + b\\)) times 2 (sum of coefficients in \\(c + 1/c\\)). So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm by actually expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and finding the sum of its coefficients. The sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of two polynomials. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, I think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Does that mean the \\(c\\) terms don't matter? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part involves \\(c\\) terms, maybe those don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, actually, when we multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), right? So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by various \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which is a variable, and coefficients are typically constants. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second part. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient is the sum of all those terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has coefficients that are binomial coefficients, and the sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of both parts. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but that would make the coefficient dependent on \\(c\\), which isn't possible. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you expand the entire expression, the terms will be of the form \\(a^k b^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^n}\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering that \\(c\\) can be any term, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which isn't possible. Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, that would mean I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, let me break it down. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second part, so to get \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need the term in the second part where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is needed. Let me find that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\): \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(k = 3\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the entire expression, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, so when we multiply by the second part, which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, in this case, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is a single term, and when multiplied by each term of the second polynomial, it would create multiple terms in the product. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only present in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would actually become \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\). But in that case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all terms from the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) where \\(k\\) can range from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is even between -6 and 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would again give 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power. That would make more sense, because otherwise the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. In that case, I need to find the term where in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me find that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when considering all coefficients in the second expansion. However, if the problem is asking specifically for the term where \\(c^0\\) is present, then it's 120. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make it a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't typical in such problems. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient is 120. Let me just verify that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Yes, that seems correct.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you still get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the term we're interested in. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But in this case, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, we need to consider the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand both, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That makes sense because any other term would have a power of \\(c\\) and thus wouldn't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yeah, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120. But let me just verify that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The term with \\(c^0\\) (which is needed to keep the exponent of \\(c\\) zero) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients**:\n   - \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply if the variables are the same. But in this case, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), maybe I can treat them separately. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would affect the overall expression, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a part of each term in the product. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\), each with their coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply these two together, each term from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but no, the problem just says \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, that suggests that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct either because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just 6 times each term in the second expansion. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times each of the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because it's multiplied by other variables. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems correct because each term in the second expansion is contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expression, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try another approach. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the variables are irrelevant. So, in that case, the coefficient is 6, and the rest is multiplied by other terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient equal to 6 times each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we need to sum over all the possible coefficients from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. When multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64 (found by setting \\(c = 1\\)). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Hmm, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then it would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expression will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term.

But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times whatever the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is 6a^2b^2, and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term with its own variables, so when you multiply 6a^2b^2 by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get 6a^2b^2c^6, which is a different term. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that the other variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are set to 1 or something. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the problem again: it says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's not looking for the coefficient in the entire expansion considering all variables, but rather, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, how do I find the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me think again. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the first part, and the second part contributes a factor that multiplies it, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think 384 is the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which is 6a^2b^2, gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression would have terms like 6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, etc., depending on the expansion of the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes a coefficient times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as I calculated earlier, then the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that approach. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent is 0. So, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent is 0, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, which is it? Is it 384 or 120? Hmm, this is confusing. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that it's considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me think differently. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But wait, let me confirm by expanding a smaller case. Let me take \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). So, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). Now, multiplying these together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, in this case, when you multiply \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from \\(b^2\\) times \\(a^2\\), but wait, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. Wait, actually, in this product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2*2\\), \\(a^2*(1/c^2)\\). Similarly, the \\(2ab\\) term is multiplied by each term, so \\(2ab c^2\\), \\(2ab*2\\), \\(2ab*(1/c^2)\\), and the \\(b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term, so \\(b^2c^2\\), \\(2b^2\\), \\(b^2*(1/c^2)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient from \\(b^2\\). Wait, but in this case, the \\(a^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) in the second polynomial. But wait, no, because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(b\\) terms. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of it differently. The problem is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, each term is of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^{k}b^{m}c^{n}. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 2\\), but since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) terms, the coefficients from the second polynomial don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not right because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which are all coefficients times \\(c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

When we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that sum is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 times 64, which is 384? But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part is just a constant factor that multiplies it. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is not a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But again, that gives a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking for. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part is just a separate factor, so the overall coefficient is 6. But that seems incorrect because the second part is raised to the 6th power and is multiplied by the first part. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would make more sense. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let me assume that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. So, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer is 120. But wait, the original problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm assuming something that's not there. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, that means that in the entire expansion, any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that's a polynomial, so maybe the problem is miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and just find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number. Therefore, I think the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the next step is to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're multiplying two expressions together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to consider the entire expansion of the second part, but just the constant term, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, which is a function of \\(c\\), it would result in terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expression, we'd get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean that the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) must be a constant term, because otherwise, the product would have \\(c\\) terms attached. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's being multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20, so the overall coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me just verify that I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120.

Since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how these two parts interact. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part. The second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when we multiply the two expressions together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient doesn't change? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the other expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product, so when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But actually, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion, but actually, each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that seems wrong because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a single number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire expression, which includes the \\(c\\) terms, but only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Let me confirm this with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The expansion would be \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so 1*2=2, which is correct because in the expansion, the terms with \\(a\\) are \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, applying the same logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, because the other terms are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But that contradicts the earlier reasoning. Let me think carefully. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the sums of the products of coefficients from each polynomial whose exponents add up to the desired term. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and it is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, another way to see this is that when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, the expression becomes \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? Or is the problem only concerned with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not the \\(c\\) part? Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion. But wait, in the entire expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But wait, that doesn't seem correct because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be right because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), but the entire expression includes terms with \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient is just \\(6\\) times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get a term that is \\(6 \\times\\) constant term \\( \\times a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because other terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would involve powers of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). How do I do that? Let me recall that the general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two independent expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, their product would give the term \\(120a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found. Then, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not correct because the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\). Let me calculate that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which contradicts what I found earlier. So, I must be making a mistake here. Wait, no, that approach is wrong because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) isn't just 64. Wait, when \\(c = 1\\), \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients, but in our case, we only want the constant term, not all coefficients. So, the previous approach was correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120. I think I confused myself for a moment there, but now I'm confident that 120 is the right coefficient.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes with a coefficient of 6 in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we might need to consider how this term interacts with the second part of the expression. Wait, but actually, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second part. So, when we multiply them out, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But in this case, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in another. So, when you multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first polynomial, the multiplication by the second polynomial will only scale this term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not be accurate because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the entire second part, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps we just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second part, but that would give a coefficient that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems odd because then the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. That might make more sense. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product. \n\nIf that's the case, then I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the overall coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAgain, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", and I'm interpreting it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial interpretation is correct: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nLet me double-check my steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). \n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\n3. Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\n4. Multiply the two coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
