    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, so does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Or is there more to it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, there are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient might not just be 6? Or perhaps the question is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just along for the ride? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to parse the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe the question is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as a variable that's separate, so the coefficient might actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions usually refers to the term where the variables multiply in a certain way. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in the expansion would be multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the variables are separate. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would mean the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if I consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m \\). Simplifying the exponents for \\(c\\), that would be \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then include terms with \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or specifically when \\(c\\) is raised to some power? Because if it's regardless, then the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I found earlier. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that doesn't make much sense because coefficients are typically constants, not expressions involving variables.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's not specifying any particular power of \\(c\\), which makes me think that the coefficient might include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, which again would not be a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense, and the answer would be 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^3\\)\" or something like that, but as it stands, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to find the constant term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that's when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Therefore, the answer is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). So, the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's just 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, to recap, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 120, which I believe is the answer the problem is looking for.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps and double-checked my work, so I feel confident that the answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the terms from each expansion will multiply each other. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, that would mean that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second expansion, because any other term would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want in the final term \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is it correct to just multiply the two coefficients together? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply if the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part and the constant term (which is 1, but with coefficient 20) comes from the second part, so yes, their coefficients multiply. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should write out the expansions more carefully. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) when expanded will have terms like \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term of the second part. But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second factor contributes a constant, i.e., 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the product of the binomial coefficients from each expansion. \n\n1.

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I'm not sure if that part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't affect that coefficient. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by it, but since \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, actually, the entire expression is the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only terms that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the terms where \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are multiplied together in such a way that they form a constant term, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so when I multiply it by any term from the second expansion, I have to consider that the term from the second expansion must not involve \\(c\\) at all, meaning it's a constant term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20, when I multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part that will give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. All other terms from the second expansion will introduce some power of \\(c\\), which won't be part of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the expression is a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part, as I thought before. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think differently. Let me consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\(k = 2\\), as before, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you have to consider all possible ways to get the term. But in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two separate coefficients, since the variables are independent. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so their product is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Suppose I take a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The first expansion gives me terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), \\(b^4\\). The second expansion gives me terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Now, when I multiply these together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for example, \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(20\\) would give \\(120a^2b^2\\). But if I take \\(6a^2b^2\\) and multiply it by any other term from the second expansion, like \\(c^6\\), that would give me \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by \\(15/c^2\\) would give \\(90a^2b^2/c^2\\), which also isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, giving me 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other terms. Suppose I take a different term from the first expansion, like \\(4a^3b\\), and multiply it by a term from the second expansion that somehow cancels the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, because \\(4a^3b\\) is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so it would result in terms like \\(4a^3b c^6\\), \\(4a^3b \\times 6c^4\\), etc., none of which are \\(a^2b^2\\). Similarly, taking \\(a^4\\) and multiplying by a term from the second expansion would give terms like \\(a^4 c^6\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when I take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit uncertain because sometimes when you have products of polynomials, you can have cross terms contributing to the same term. But in this case, since the variables are different, I don't think that's possible. For example, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by combining terms with \\(c\\) because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. So, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, if I were to write out the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear as a result of multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. All other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I made any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. Let me recalculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, which is correct because 4 choose 2 is 6. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, because 6! / (3!3!) = (720)/(6*6) = 720/36 = 20. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the final answer should be 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of an alternative approach. Suppose I consider the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and think about how the terms combine. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is the product of the two individual coefficients, which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when we multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that this term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not any specific term involving \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c^k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the coefficient when the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, but that might not be the case. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if we consider all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem specifies \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not make sense because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients would be 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. Let me check that approach.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), it just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting the variable to 1. So, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused now. Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), or is it asking for the coefficient when considering \\(c^0\\)? The problem statement is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In other words, it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When we multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's the sum over all \\(k\\), so 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a small example to see if this makes sense. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. Now, if we multiply by \\((c + 1/c)\\), each term in \\((a + b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\((c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is 1. Similarly for \\(a^0b^1\\). So, if we were to find the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is the same as 1*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when \\(c = 1\\) is 2. So, indeed, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1*2 = 2.\n\nTherefore, applying this logic to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*(sum of coefficients in the second polynomial). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) was 20, so if I multiply that by 6, I get 120. So, which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, it's 384.\n\nWait, but in the small example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of coefficients, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1*2. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) term, so perhaps it's just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 6*20 = 120.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it could mean two things:\n\n1. The coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In this case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\n2. The coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In this case, it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6*20 = 120.\n\nWhich interpretation is correct? The problem statement is a bit ambiguous, but in mathematical problems, when multiple variables are present and a specific term is asked for, it's often implied that all other variables are set to their lowest possible exponents, typically zero. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is the second one, where we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, but in the small example I did earlier, if I had \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\), and I asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it's 2, which corresponds to 1*(1 + 1). So, in that case, it's the sum of coefficients. So, perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's consider the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6*(sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would be 6*(coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part) = 6*20 = 120.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I think it's more likely that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the product of its coefficient and the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120. I'm getting conflicting interpretations. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nIf the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6*20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem statement is \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\), I think the intended interpretation is the first one, where we're considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384.\n\nBut to make sure, let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which typically would mean the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the other variables. So, in the product, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^l c^{-m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have any exponent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-m}\\) for any \\(m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6*64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's expand both parts separately and then see how they multiply.\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\).\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6 is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has a total sum of 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here because the second part also has variables. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, that makes me think that maybe the terms involving \\(c\\) don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When I multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then maybe the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term from the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the product will have a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, each term will have a coefficient. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's essentially the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that each term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), it's just the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms. So, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, and the coefficients add up. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, which has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, ..., c^{-6}\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all those products. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. Let me check: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, when \\(k = 3\\), we get \\(c^{6 - 6} = c^0 = 1\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would only be multiplied by the constant term from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify: If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. Wait, in the original problem, it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\), and any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because in the second polynomial, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But that's the same as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). The sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, they might consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\), and the coefficient for each of these terms would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of coefficients, which would be \\( (1 * 2) = 2\\), because \\((c + 1/c)\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, sum to 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) is also squared or something, but I don't think so because the problem doesn't specify. So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me expand both parts and see. The first part is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Expanding that using the binomial theorem: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the terms are \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15c^{-2}, 6c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 6a^2b^2c^2, 6a^2b^2, 6a^2b^2c^{-2}, 6a^2b^2c^{-4}, 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, each term with \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's the sum of all these coefficients, which is 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. But that would be 6 * 20 = 120. But that's only if we're considering the term where \\(c\\) is zero, which isn't the case here. The problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think the correct approach is to sum all coefficients from the second polynomial and multiply by 6, giving 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about what the problem is asking. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), and for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, it's multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient for each of these terms is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). The sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 * 20 = 120\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) specified, it's 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in such problems, they might consider only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), but I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the answer is 384. \n\nBut let me double-check. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial: \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear multiplied by every term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think I'm confident now that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Well, the expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that term must come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in the second part. Because any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want. So, let me check that. So, first, I have the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. Hmm, I think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being the product of the two expansions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to it. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something else? But no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so any other term in the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the overall term include \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term would contribute. So, yeah, I think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term. The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3.

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so does this mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times something? Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't actually need to consider the \\(c\\) terms, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the terms from the second part, but since those terms involve \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct either. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), so its coefficient is 6. Then, when I multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is not affected by the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, that approach might not be correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form it. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire product. So, does that mean that in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we are looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and what is its coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms? But that can't be right because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so it would actually be a sum of terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{(terms from the second expansion)}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. But since the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term of the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and multiply by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we are considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, when you expand the entire product, each term will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product isn't just a single number because it's part of multiple terms depending on \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the overall coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a scalar. Wait, no, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because in the first part, the highest power of \\(a\\) is 2 and \\(b\\) is 0, and similarly for the other terms. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^0\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^1\\) would be 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^{-1}\\) would be 1, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because there's no \\(b\\) in the first term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which makes sense because in the first expansion, the highest power of \\(b\\) is 2, but in \\((a + b)^2\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present; actually, it is present as \\(2a^1b^1\\), but \\(a^2b^2\\) would require a higher power. Wait, no, in \\((a + b)^2\\), the terms are \\(a^2\\), \\(2ab\\), and \\(b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present in \\((a + b)^2\\), so its coefficient is zero. Therefore, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would also be zero. \n\nWait, but in my original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient isn't zero. So, going back, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. \n\nBut let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is being multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, but in the product, it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't present on its own; instead, it's part of terms that also include \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) isn't a standalone term; it's multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, and since all the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) are multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 384. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) from -6 to 6 will be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is ambiguous because \\(a^2b^2\\) alone isn't a term in the product; it's always multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero. \n\nBut that seems contradictory to the problem's phrasing. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. In that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them together. \n\nSo, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), as I calculated earlier. Now, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term when expanded. The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the coefficient was 384, but that was under the assumption that we were summing all coefficients in the second part, which isn't the case. The problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the structure of the product. \n\nWhen you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20c^0\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20c^0\\) gives \\(120a^2b^2c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is indeed 120. \n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - The constant term (where \\(c^0\\)) occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.

    "text": " So, that part gives me 6. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand that as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term is only in the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first will multiply each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and I multiply it by, say, \\(c^k\\) from the second part, then the resulting term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I'm looking for all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\)? Or is the problem considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms? Wait, that might not make sense. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's possible that the problem is treating the entire expression as a product, and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so maybe we can treat the two parts separately. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems unclear. Wait, no, I think I might be overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when we multiply it by any term from the second part, the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that might not make sense because each term in the product will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that's not a single term, so perhaps the problem is misworded, and it's intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 2^6 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term is of the form (term from first part) * (term from second part). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when multiplied by any term from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times something. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but in reality, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts in the expression. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term is in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in second part). The sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c) = c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them, we get \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no \\(a^2b^2\\) terms. Wait, but that's a problem because in this case, the coefficient is zero. Hmm, but in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, in my example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear. So, perhaps my earlier reasoning is incorrect. Wait, in my example, \\((a + b)^2\\) only goes up to \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\), but in the product, you don't get any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because that would require multiplying \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\), but the second part is in terms of \\(c\\). Wait, no, in my example, when I multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the terms are as I wrote: \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). So, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\) by any term from the second part, which is in \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4\\), so perhaps there is a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by something from the second part. Wait, but in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the term where \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term in the second part. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's calculate the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer is 120. Wait, but in my earlier example, I thought the coefficient was zero, but that was because I was considering the entire product without considering the \\(c\\) exponent. So, in the original problem, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, it would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But I'm a bit confused because in my example, that approach gave a different result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, leading to 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. When the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's referring to the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, that approach would have given me a non-zero coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), but in reality, in that example, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\) by terms in \\(c\\). Wait, no, in my example, the product is \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), which doesn't have any \\(a^2b^2\\) terms because you can't multiply \\(a^2\\) by \\(b^2\\) through the second part. So, perhaps in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first part, and when you multiply by the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would require that \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term in the second part. So, that would make the coefficient 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\), meaning that it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied in. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in my example, that approach would have given me a coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 2 * 2 = 4, but in reality, there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product because you can't get it by multiplying \\(a^2\\) or \\(b^2\\) by terms in \\(c\\). So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part. That would make sense, and the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the correct answer. Let me confirm. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if we consider the entire product, each term is a product of a term from the first part and a term from the second part. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the first part, specifically the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, when multiplied by terms from the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. The sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, this approach didn't work because there was no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem doesn't specify, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, which would be 384. However, I'm a bit unsure because in my example, this approach gave a different result. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is a red herring. But that seems unlikely. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation must be that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120. I think that makes sense because in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the constant term (if any) from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way it can be present in the product is if it's multiplied by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), because that would be the only term that doesn't add or subtract exponents of \\(c\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're essentially considering all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by terms from the second expression. But wait, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a constant term (i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) from the second expression. Because if it's multiplied by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something like that, not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6. That makes sense. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, that's correct. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then multiplying the relevant coefficients.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(m = 3\\), giving the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part.\n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I notice that this part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think we can treat the second part as a constant when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that right? Let me think. No, actually, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and then the rest of the expression is multiplied by that. But wait, no, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficients of the terms in each expression multiply when you're looking for a specific term in the product. So, for example, if you have \\(A \\times B\\), where \\(A\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(B\\). But since \\(B\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), every term in \\(B\\) will just add to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the corresponding term from \\(A\\). Wait, no, that's not correct either. Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when you multiply \\(A\\) by \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(B\\) is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second part, it will create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe when they say the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they mean the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing to the overall coefficient. But wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would only be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, actually, I think I was wrong earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because only that term would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nNow, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So when you multiply the two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables multiply to give the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second polynomial where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), and multiply that coefficient with the coefficient from the first polynomial.\n\nSo, yeah, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. For the second part, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) is also correct. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so maybe the coefficient from the first part is all I need? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of two parts, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\).

Wait, no, actually, that might not be the case. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from each term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) aren't all the same. Each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a different coefficient. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64, which is 384. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression isn't just 6 times the sum of coefficients, but rather, each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the other part is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only include the term where \\(k = 0\\). So, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by 6. \n\nAlright, so let's focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which equals 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

I wonder if I need to expand this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, actually, no.

But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the question is only concerned with the terms that involve \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), each multiplication just adds another coefficient from the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check this again because I might have made a mistake. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

But that seems confusing because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has many terms, so how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)). \n\nAs I calculated earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of the coefficients. To find the sum of coefficients in a polynomial, you substitute each variable with 1. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second part, the coefficient becomes 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient, not the entire term, perhaps it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing coefficients with terms. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its own coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, that's consistent with what I thought earlier. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. \n\nWait, but let me just double-check my calculations. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6, and \\(2^6\\) is 64, so 6 * 64 is 384. Yep, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

    "text": " So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this as well, but I'm not sure how it relates to finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I don't need to expand the entire expression. Perhaps I just need to consider the product of the two expansions. Let me think: \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be a specific value, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you get a product where each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way a term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) includes terms with various powers of \\(c\\), so unless we're looking for a specific term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient? But that would require multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not a number, it's a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a constant. That doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a single polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the sum of all coefficients where the term has \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the rest is just multiplied as a constant. Wait, that can't be right because \\(c\\) is a variable, not a constant. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by that, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But again, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, meaning the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). That seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which is the sum of all coefficients in that part. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, so multiplying them gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 384. Alternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, and not the entire term, perhaps we need to evaluate the second polynomial at \\(c = 1\\) to get the sum of its coefficients, which is 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384. That seems to make sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand both parts separately and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem gives \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), perhaps we need to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial. Wait, no, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the coefficient being 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a number. So, the only way to get a numerical coefficient is to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, and then multiply by 6 to get 384. So, I think that's the correct approach. Let me recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 * 64 = 384\\). So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But we're only interested in the terms where the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\), giving a coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as the product of the two expansions. So, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's the sum of all the products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is only the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (constant term from second expansion). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that since the two parts are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of the term that doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) in the second part, which is the constant term, which we found to be 20. So, 6 times 20 is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me check if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or something else, but I think the binomial approach is correct here. \n\nWait, another way: perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is the product of two separate expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is exactly what I did. So, that seems correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which equals 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. 6 times 20 is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by considering each part separately. First, using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Next, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression would have terms involving both \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, wait a second, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I'm only supposed to find the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant; it's another expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\(\\left(x + y\\right)^n\\) is obtained by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, that seems possible. But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, when you have two separate variables, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, when you expand the entire expression, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is indeed 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of it differently. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when you multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a separate expansion, so the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient should be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. As I calculated earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. So, yes, 384 seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding it, I get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. But in reality, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times (1 + 1) = 2, which matches. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 2, and similarly for \\(a^0b^1\\). So, applying the same logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as part of the same expression, but I don't think so because the variables are separate. So, I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me try to compute it differently. Let me first compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Then, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when I write the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). So, each of these terms is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all these coefficients, which is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is 1 (from the first expansion) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second expansion). So, yes, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), whose sum of coefficients is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a separate term, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire product, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the coefficient for each of these terms would be 6 times the corresponding coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's the coefficient when considering the product as a whole, so it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. Hmm, I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, in this case, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, then yes, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because the problem includes the entire expression, so it's part of the product. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) to be sure. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial is just 6 times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c^k\\) terms. So, the coefficient is 6 times the entire second polynomial, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), so 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). Now, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), the value would be 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the value when \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, so perhaps using partial derivatives or something else, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think I was right earlier that it's 384 because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient becomes 6 times each coefficient in the second polynomial, and when you consider all of them, it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and when multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0c^1\\) is 1, and \\(a^1b^0c^{-1}\\) is also 1. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1, multiplied by \\((c + 1/c)\\), so same as above. Now, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\), it would be 1 times the entire \\((c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\) is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, in this simpler case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the correct answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Since \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a sum of coefficients equal to \\(2^6 = 64\\) when \\(c = 1\\), the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does this second part affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, I'm going to have terms that are products of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from the second expansion that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but the second expansion only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). That means, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, the resulting term will still be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). But wait, that might not be right. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, no. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\), then each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean we're looking for all terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we need to sum their coefficients? Or are we supposed to consider only the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it not a pure \\(a^2b^2\\) term?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that we're looking for the coefficient in the entire expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so each term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, any term from the first part will be multiplied by any term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient for each such term is just the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^6\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), and similarly, multiplying by \\(c^5\\) gives \\(a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, right? Because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, making it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the term in the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the product of the coefficients from each part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the entire product. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m\\). Simplifying, that's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would require \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as before. So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNow, for the second part, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero so that the term is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two coefficients because the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Could there be other terms where the product results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? Well, no, because the second part only contributes \\(c\\) terms, so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the overall coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the part with \\(c\\) doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe. Let me think. Since we're multiplying two expressions together, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the multiplication affects it. \n\nWait, actually, no. Because when we multiply the two expressions, any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and their coefficients will be multiplied by the corresponding coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems a bit confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nLet me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're looking for the sum of all coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would then include terms with various powers of \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient in the sense of the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might not be right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every possible term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient being 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is multiplied by all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's the case. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of a term in P(a, b), say \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would accumulate all the coefficients from Q(c). \n\nTherefore, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think of it differently. Let me expand both parts and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4\\) has the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\) for k from 0 to 6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes its coefficient to the product. \n\nSo, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64, as we found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm by another method. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term in the second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\). So, I think the correct approach is to consider the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and multiply by 6 to get 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when multiplied by any term in the second expansion, it will just have a coefficient that's the product of the coefficients. So, each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2k}\\), each with coefficient \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct by another approach. Let me compute the entire product and see. \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nSo, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times (1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1)\\). Wait, that's \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\), which matches our previous result. \n\nWait, but hold on, when I compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think of the sum of coefficients, I could have expanded both expressions and multiplied, but that would be more time-consuming. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in calculating the sum of coefficients. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) when \\(c = 1\\): it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"
