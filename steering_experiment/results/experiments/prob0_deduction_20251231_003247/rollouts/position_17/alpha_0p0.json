    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is in terms of \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term on its own, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that \\(c\\) terms are being treated as separate variables. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, which would mean that the coefficient would include terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, perhaps I should look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way it would be a standalone term. So, maybe I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 120. Wait, but let me check that again. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. When you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and instead thought that the coefficient is 6 regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would be incorrect because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by 6. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will multiply each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only occur if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when the second part is 20, the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (or the term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that won't introduce any additional \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) factors. So, let's focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. That is, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term 20. Multiplying these together, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct coefficient. I don't think I made any mistakes here. I considered each part separately, found the relevant coefficients, and then multiplied them together since the terms are independent. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the \\(c\\) terms don't interact with them.

Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simple. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is that the entire expression is a product, and \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, so when multiplied by the second part, which is a series in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typically what is asked. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so that the overall term is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, let's break it down. First, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part because the terms are multiplied together. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other part is 20, so when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by all terms in the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, we only take the 20 from the second part. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being a multiplication of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be a sum over all the coefficients from the second polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120 is the correct answer. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) corresponds to \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the two coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a very large number, and I don't think that's the case. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the original coefficient times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since the product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part just contributes a factor that multiplies the entire \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a sum over all terms, which doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m}\\) where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers between 0 and 4 and 0 and 6 respectively. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and I'm interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by this constant term 20 in the second part. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, now I'm getting a different answer. Which one is correct? Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes all powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), that means we need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a sum over all coefficients in the second part. However, that doesn't make sense because the problem is expecting a single numerical coefficient, not an expression. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, as calculated before. Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, in my second approach, I considered only the constant term in the second expansion, which gave me 120. Now I'm confused because I'm getting two different answers. Let me try to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term in the second expansion, which includes different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). However, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then we would need to find the corresponding term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), we have to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which means the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when you multiply by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion adds a multiple of 6 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try a small example to test this. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Let me try another example: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. But in our original problem, the coefficient is a numerical value because it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), implying a number. Therefore, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem asks for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. No, actually, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion will be a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I must find the part of the product where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, in other words, when I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by a term from the second part that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because if I multiply by a term with \\(c^k\\) or \\(1/c^k\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which has no \\(c\\) terms, that coefficient must come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0 because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So that's \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for the constant term, so when multiplied, they give 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, the coefficient should be 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here. I considered both expansions separately, found the required terms, and multiplied them together.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll end up with a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k=3\\), so the coefficient is 20. So, multiplying these together, 6 * 20 = 120.

The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 1, because when you multiply by the entire expression in \\(c\\), each term is a scalar. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient remains 6, and the answer is 6. But that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) and \\(a, b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I do that, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high. Wait, let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients in that part is 64. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by 64, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the variables \\(a, b, c\\) are all present, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\), but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6, but when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar, not a polynomial. Wait, maybe I'm confusing terms. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients do get multiplied. Wait, no, actually, when you're looking for the coefficient of a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in the product of two expressions, you have to consider that each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a scalar that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that seems unlikely, because the problem includes both parts, so I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part, which is 64, giving 384. Wait, but let me check that again. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me expand it to check: \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c) = (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(a^2 * c + a^2 * 1/c\\), so the coefficient is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a scalar. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is not a scalar but a term involving \\(c\\). But in the problem, we're asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, in my example, I was looking for \\(a^2\\), but in the problem, it's \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the problem, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when multiplied by the other expression, it would become \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but in the example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a term, not a scalar. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then it would involve the coefficients from both expressions. But in the problem, we're just asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any conditions on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach gave a term, not a scalar, so maybe I'm making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems unlikely. Let me try to clarify the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a scalar that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in my earlier example, when I took \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a scalar, so that approach seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6, because the other part doesn't affect it. But that contradicts the earlier example. Wait, no, in the problem, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384. Let me confirm this with another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), we get \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a scalar, so the approach seems inconsistent. Therefore, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider only the coefficient in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. But in the expansion, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps it's just 6. Wait, but that contradicts the earlier example. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would involve all possible combinations of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But in my earlier example, that approach didn't hold because the coefficient became a term involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect it, which would make the coefficient 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one affects all terms in the other. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate variables. So, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it's like multiplying by a scalar in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is not a scalar; it's a polynomial. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't make sense because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a scalar that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not possible because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms involving \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, giving 384. But in that case, the coefficient would be 384, and the term would be \\(384a^2b^2\\), but that seems incorrect because when you expand the product, each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), not a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is irrelevant. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. So, after considering all this, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't influence the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Therefore, the answer is 6.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion, giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and not the terms involving \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{6}."

    "text": " Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). Hmm, but actually, when you multiply the two expansions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because \\(c^0\\) is 1, and that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) would appear without any \\(c\\) terms. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which is 6. Wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. When you have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the expansion would be a product of two sums. So, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first expansion, and it would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that means we need the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The first part gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), and since \\(c\\) is multiplied by terms from the other expansion, but we're only looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), so yes, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of both parts. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would give a term involving \\(c\\) as well. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that's separate from \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part as a separate variable or as a constant when considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because that's the only way to get a term without \\(c\\). So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found earlier as 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do that, we can use the binomial theorem again. Let's write \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the product of the coefficients? Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply when the variables multiply. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, yes, the coefficients multiply, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Let me just double-check my calculations to be sure. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), that's correct. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yep, that seems right. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we have to sum all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion and multiply by 6.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) part. So, perhaps the \\(c\\) part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that each multiplication by a term in the \\(c\\) expansion would result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get different terms, none of which are just \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems off. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^4\\), etc., depending on how the \\(c\\) terms expand. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then we can consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a specific power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're effectively summing all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion and then multiplying by 6. But that seems confusing. Wait, perhaps another approach: The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do we find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me verify that because I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) expansion is multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(1\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. When we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a different term, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without considering \\(c\\)) would require that the \\(c\\) terms are such that they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, as calculated before, then 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, is a Laurent polynomial (since it has negative exponents). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion, each term contributes to a different term in the product, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we have to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear, which is by multiplying it by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from the \\(c\\) expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that's 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a constant term 20, so when I multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me double-check my steps. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient. Then, I realized that to get a term without \\(c\\), I needed the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent to zero and solving for \\(k\\). That gave me \\(k = 3\\), and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

So, when I expand the whole thing, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't matter because they don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only considering the term without \\(c\\), which is actually not present because all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) have some power of \\(c\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just \\(6a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, it would actually be \\(6\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because that would give me a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a lot of \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, we're looking for a specific term in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check that logic. Because when I multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when I multiply them, it's 6 * 20 * a^2b^2 * c^0, which is 120a^2b^2. So, the coefficient is indeed 120. But wait, is that correct? Because in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, but only the constant term (c^0) will contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. All other terms would result in higher or lower powers of \\(c\\), which would not be part of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So yes, I think that's correct. So, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the coefficients, since the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so their product is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6, correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent is 0 is when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant terms.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   - Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) has the coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   - Find the term with \\(c^0\\) (the constant term), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n   - The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients**:\n   - Multiply the coefficients from each expansion: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\).

When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial.

So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me check what the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so we just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and since the other part is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial.

Therefore, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the answer would just be 6. But that seems too simple, and the problem includes the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are part of the same expression. So, perhaps we're supposed to treat the entire product as a single polynomial and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But let me check that again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I found earlier by substituting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, if I multiply that by 6, I get 384. So, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it differently. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem.

Wait, that seems right, but let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, when you multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that makes sense. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire expansion as a product and see if any terms would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (if any) from the second part, or maybe by some term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second expansion.

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, let me check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, perhaps I should proceed under that assumption. So, let me try that approach. So, first, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which we found to be 6. Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, which is the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That seems reasonable. So, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term. So, yes, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term and just multiplied by the entire expansion, the coefficient would be a polynomial, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's implied that they want the coefficient when considering all possible terms, which would mean taking the constant term from the \\(c\\) part. So, I think 120 is the correct answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the constant term is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.

We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 120. But wait, the problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it again. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate, and the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all terms, but that would still involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but just looking for the coefficient as a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean treating \\(c\\) as a constant, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial, not a number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, perhaps that's the answer. Let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that's probably the answer the problem is looking for. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be 6(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical answer. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any specific term involving \\(c\\), maybe we can treat the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a single coefficient? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will multiply each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient we're looking for is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all the terms from the \\(c\\) expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which includes all possible combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, and that term is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Hmm, that seems possible, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), so it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, no, because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for various \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, no, because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^m\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, so when you multiply by 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's including all terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but let me verify this another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me check this again. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a single expression and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this and the answer is simply 6, but that seems too simple. Wait, but let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6, resulting in terms like 6 * (coefficient of \\(c^k\\)) * \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. That would be different. Let me check that as well. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is the constant term. To find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). To find the term where \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) \u2192 \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient is 384. But if it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Hmm, I need to clarify this. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term, and \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But as it stands, I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of all coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake here. Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once in \\((a + b)^4\\), with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized that the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. So, that's 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Maybe I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only 6, and the rest of the expression is separate. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in one polynomial is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the other part. So, I think 384 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: if I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) is multiplied by the entire Q(c). So, in this case, P(a, b) is \\((a + b)^4\\) and Q(c) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) times Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * Q(c), but since we're looking for the coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, no, because in the product, each term is a product of terms from P and Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because each term in Q(c) is a coefficient times a power of c, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times that coefficient. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, it's the sum of all these 6 * (coefficients in Q(c)). Therefore, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product and look for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of c. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q(c), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when c = 1, which is (1 + 1)^6 = 64. So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, the coefficients can be more nuanced. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. So, I think 384 is the right answer.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2. Alternatively, if I expand it, it's \\(a(c + 1/c) + b(c + 1/c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{384}"

Wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I might be misunderstanding something. Wait, no, actually, no.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on, let me think again. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand both, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, that can't be right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because it's in the product. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the answer is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is 384, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 times 20 is 120. That seems more plausible. Let me check that again. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term is \\(20c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that would also be 120. But the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's 120. Wait, but let me think again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so 6 times 64 is 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would make the coefficient a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
