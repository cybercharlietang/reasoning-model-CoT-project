    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will just get multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can just take the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be necessary. Let me think again. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will get multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be \\(6\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a numerical value, not an expression involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, no, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a binomial expansion \\((x + y)^n\\) is found by setting \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^n = 2^n\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times \\(c^k\\) for some exponent \\(k\\), and when I multiply by \\(6a^2b^2\\), each term will be \\(6 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, because each term contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64, so 6 times 64 is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\), perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as I thought earlier, which is 6. Then, when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, contributing their coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplying terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times whatever the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, maybe I need to consider that when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a separate part, and when I multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would just be multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that seems like it would be an infinite series or something. Wait, no, actually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a finite expansion. Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that result in a constant term (i.e., no \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factors) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first expansion, and the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would just be the coefficient from the first expansion times the entire expansion of the second, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and consider the entire expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be the sum when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) would give the sum of all coefficients. So, maybe I can compute \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which would give me the sum of all coefficients, and then multiply that by 6. Let me try that. So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it means that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, as I calculated earlier, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. So, maybe the answer is 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make sense because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, that would involve both expansions. So, let me approach it that way. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I need to consider the product of terms from each expansion such that the exponents add up to 2 for \\(a\\), 2 for \\(b\\), and 0 for \\(c\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is as we found, with coefficient 6. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we need the term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where this exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. So, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which would give me the coefficient if I were looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) times all possible \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically, which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first expansion. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me verify that. So, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is indeed when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. So, multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Therefore, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This happens when \\(k = 3\\) in the binomial expansion, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by whatever the entire expansion of the second part is.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by 6a^2b^2, but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be necessary because maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. If I have two separate expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which would make each term's coefficient just the numerical coefficient. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which has a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably asking for the numerical coefficient, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so maybe I need to consider that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the problem might not require that. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems like it's not just a number. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get a product where each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - m}\\), depending on how the terms combine. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and then sum their coefficients, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and we want the total coefficient for all such terms. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 64 from the second part, giving 384. But let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's the product of two polynomials. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems to confirm it. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the problem perhaps asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) is to the power of zero? Because if that's the case, then I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. So, let's check that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, in that case, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. However, sometimes in such problems, people might be interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify that. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But to make sure, let me think again. If I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the entire product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or similar, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. But just to be thorough, let me check the sum of coefficients in the second expansion again. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, the sum of all coefficients is 64, and multiplying by 6 gives 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my initial approach. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\( \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Therefore, the product will have terms \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients for all \\(m\\), which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, that seems correct. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider a simpler example to test my approach. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 1 (from the term \\(c^0\\)). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 1 = 1. But if I apply my method, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\((1 + 1)^1 = 2\\), so the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2, which is incorrect because the actual coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, not 2. Wait, that suggests that my approach is wrong. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.\n\nWait, in this simpler example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 1 = 1, not 1 * 2 = 2. So, my earlier approach was incorrect. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assuming that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I see. The problem is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in the case of \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 1, because it's only multiplied by the constant term (1) in the second polynomial. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(m\\) of [coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part] times [coefficient of \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) in the second part]. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the variables are separate. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficients from the second polynomial, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because in the simpler example, it's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in my simple example, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, giving 2, but that's incorrect because the actual coefficient is 1. So, that suggests that this approach is wrong. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that the coefficient is 384 must be wrong.\n\nWait, but in the simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 1, so it's 1 * 1 = 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Because in the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we saw earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 1, giving 1. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I misunderstood the problem. I thought it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so that must be incorrect.\n\nWait, no, in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 1, giving 1. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 1 = 1, which is correct. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. So, that must be the correct approach.\n\nWait, so the confusion was whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) or specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). If it's the former, then it's 384, but if it's the latter, it's 120. But in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, which corresponds to \\(a^1c^0\\), so it's the latter. Therefore, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so that can't be correct. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply to give that specific term. So, in the original problem, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, in the simple example, \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 1, giving 1, which is correct. So, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. Therefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, but that seems to be incorrect because in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then the approach would be to find the product of the coefficients. But if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), then perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer, so perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, in the simple example, the problem would be to find the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The answer is 1, because it's \\(a \\times 1\\) (the constant term in the second polynomial). So, the coefficient is 1 * 1 = 1. But if I applied the approach of 1 * sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, I would get 2, which is wrong. So, that suggests that the correct approach is to only consider the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my initial thought. So, I need to resolve this confusion. Let me think carefully. The problem is: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial involves \\(c\\). When you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the product will have terms \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But in the simple example, that approach gave the wrong answer. So, why is that?\n\nWait, in the simple example, the term \\(a\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the product has terms \\(a c\\) and \\(a \\times 1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is only from the term where \\(c\\) is multiplied by 1, which is \\(a \\times 1\\), because \\(a c\\) is a different term. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is only 1, not 2. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only the coefficient from the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, because otherwise, the term would have a power of \\(c\\), making it a different term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, so in the simple example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 1, giving 1. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120, not 384. I must have made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients, which is incorrect because only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, making them different terms. So, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So, the initial mistake was thinking that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all terms from the second polynomial, but in reality, only the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0 contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), as other terms would have a different power of \\(c\\), making them separate terms. Therefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nLet me just confirm this with another example to be sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 2. The second polynomial, \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 2. So, the product would be:\n\n\\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 2, giving 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, giving 2. The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2, giving 4. So, the product would have terms like \\(2a^2\\), \\(4ab\\), and \\(2b^2\\), along with other terms involving \\(c^2\\) and \\(1/c^2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (from the second polynomial). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) is 4, which is 2 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (from the second polynomial). So, this confirms that the coefficient of a specific term in the first polynomial is multiplied by the coefficient of the corresponding term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve the other variables. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120.\n\nTherefore, after correcting my earlier mistake, I conclude that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so their coefficients don't affect each other. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that term will only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply, each term from the first part gets multiplied by each term from the second part, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you take any other term from the second part, which has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would introduce a \\(c\\) term into the product, which we don't want. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part gives 6, the second part gives 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. So, yeah, I think 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only present in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just get multiplied by 1, or perhaps the constant term? Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\).

When you expand this, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) (for any k) would be part of the product.

So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all the terms, but that would require more work. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is: What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all terms in the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times 1, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) because if you consider the entire product, you might have terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\) for some k, and perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). But the problem didn't specify that, it just said the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6. But that seems unlikely because the expression includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is probably not what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, but that seems contradictory because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, as I calculated earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient would be 384. But let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, meaning that we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so perhaps I need to consider how the two expansions interact. Wait, no, actually, no. Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables independent of \\(c\\), so when you multiply two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, maybe the problem is considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be combined with any term from the other expansion, but the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right either because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Wait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just 6, as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is just a multiplier. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire product. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. But the problem didn't specify \\(c\\), so I'm not sure. Let me think again. If I expand both parts separately, then \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Let me do that. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms, resulting in terms like \\(6 \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the sum of all coefficients from each of these terms. Wait, but that's not quite right because each term is a separate term in the product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all the coefficients from each of these products. But that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too large. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as that's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part is just a separate factor. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) being multiplied by a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each of those terms. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times\\) the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, as that's the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part is just a separate factor. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, let's approach it that way. So, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we want \\(c^0\\). So, let's find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. As I expanded earlier, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the final answer would be 120. Wait, that makes sense. So, I think I was overcomplicating it earlier by considering all the terms, but actually, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but more accurately, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the expansion of each part separately and then combining the relevant coefficients.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   To find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), solve \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), giving \\(m = 3\\).

But since the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps I can just consider the coefficient from the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient in the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients add up. Wait, no, actually, if you have \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't affect it. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. Wait, no, actually, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you're effectively scaling it by each coefficient in the second polynomial. So, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again: if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has 64 as the sum of its coefficients, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) because the other terms don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients do get scaled by the other polynomial's coefficients. Wait, but actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are scaled by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But that would only be the case if the variables are the same, which they aren't. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 384. Wait, but let me think again: the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes the second part, which would scale the coefficient. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The expansion would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m c^{-n}\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the variables, it would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product being the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in each part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), its coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero unless it's multiplied by 1. Hmm, perhaps not.

So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that are constants, because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) component. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I should consider that any term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I'm supposed to ignore the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me clarify: when you have a product of two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all terms in the second polynomial of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial) times (coefficient of each term in the second polynomial). But since the first polynomial's coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so their coefficients add up when multiplied by 6. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, as I found earlier by setting \\(c = 1\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire expression as a product, and when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and realize that the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and find the constant term, because only the constant term would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\), then the term would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then I need to consider all terms where \\(c^k\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. But that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient in the entire expression, so it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entire expansion and see. Let me try that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm making a mistake here. When I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of the coefficients, which is 64, but does that mean that each term's coefficient is being multiplied by 6? Yes, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient is added to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will have a coefficient equal to the product of the coefficients from each part, but since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient from the second part for \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero unless it's multiplied by 1. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), their coefficients don't interfere. So, I think the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can consider that term separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, no. Because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe I just need to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part can be anything, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, that might not be right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, unless the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) will result in a term that has both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think that the coefficient would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will have a different power of \\(c\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) appears as a standalone term is if it's multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), it'll become \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me figure that out. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is when the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can treat the second part as a constant multiplier for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). But that's not the constant term. So, I think I was wrong earlier. Actually, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64, but the constant term is 20, as I found earlier. So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384, which would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) if I were considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that's not the case. Wait, no, because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, that means we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought it was 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, so now I'm confused. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, in the expanded form of the entire product, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{-m}\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in the other expansion, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, earlier I thought it was 20. So, which is correct? Let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, because when you set c=1, the sum is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 2. But if I look at the term \\(a\\), it's multiplied by c and 1/c, so the coefficient of a is 1*(1 + 1) = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of b is 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of a is 2, which is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of coefficients in the second part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64 = 384. So, that must be the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was only considering the constant term. But that was a mistake. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, every term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). If that's the case, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, then multiply them. So, in that case, it's 6*20=120. So, which is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 120. Since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in the product, every term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times anything in \\(c\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Alternatively, to confirm, let's think about how the product works. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me make sure. Let's consider a simpler example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1*(c + 1/c), so the coefficient is 1*(1 + 1) = 2 when \\(c=1\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2, which is the coefficient from the first part (1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (2). So, applying that logic, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6*64=384. Therefore, the answer should be 384. But wait, earlier I thought it was 120, considering only the constant term. So, which is correct? I think it's 384 because the problem doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6*64=384. So, I think that's the correct answer. Wait, but let me check another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all m of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because when \\(4 - k = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for all m from 0 to 6. So, that's 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m=0 to 6, which is 6*64=384. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms in \\(c\\).

But wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., where \\(c^0\\) is present.

But that can't be because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way for \\(a^2b^2\\) to appear in the product is if it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\). That makes sense. So, let's break it down into two parts: 1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). 2. Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply these two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. Okay, let's do the first part again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, the second part: finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term of the \\(c\\) expansion, which is 20, then yes, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Wait, no, because when you multiply the two expansions together, every term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first expansion, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expansion would just multiply it by a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has different powers of \\(c\\), but when we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we're only concerned with terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Because otherwise, the term would involve \\(c\\) and we wouldn't just have \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, no. The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which means that each of those terms contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, that seems a bit off, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I can treat the two expansions separately. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have various terms, each with their own coefficients. But when I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms like \\(6 \\times \\text{something}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part has a coefficient, and when you multiply them by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, how do I find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Well, the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so that part is correct, giving the coefficient 6. Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that means we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values, because each \\(m\\) gives a different power of \\(c\\), but all of them contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for each term. But wait, that's the same as the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, as I found earlier. So, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term, because otherwise, \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but perhaps the problem is considering only the constant term. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, maybe it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), meaning that the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the entire product as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so maybe it's just the coefficient without considering \\(c\\), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would just be the product of the coefficients from each expansion, treating the \\(c\\) terms as separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of 1 (i.e., the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, that makes more sense because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, we need to multiply by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But I'm confused now because earlier I thought it was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Let me clarify. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, each term in the product is a term from the first polynomial multiplied by a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplying it by any term from the second polynomial. However, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean we're considering all possible coefficients from the second polynomial, which would give us 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term), then it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I think it's the first case, where we consider all terms, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, let me check that again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But let me verify with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, and that's what we multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But wait, in the example I just did, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 2, which is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1). So, that seems correct. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient should be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But earlier, I thought that maybe the problem is only considering the constant term, but I think that's not the case. The problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), so we have to consider all possible terms, meaning that the coefficient is 384. However, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when people ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, they might be considering only the terms where the variables match exactly, but in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct answer is 384. But let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms don't affect \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion. Wait, but that can't be, because the second expansion is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the concept. Let me think differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. So, which one is it? The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, I think it's the first case, where we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384. But I'm still a bit uncertain. Let me try to see if 384 makes sense. Let's consider a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficients are multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we consider the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is the product of the two binomials. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would correspond to \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), as I found earlier. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, for each \\(m\\), the term from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since we want the overall term to not have any \\(c\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) must be zero. So, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(6 - m = m\\), so \\(2m = 6\\), \\(m = 3\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term from the other expansion is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it, so the entire expression would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k \\times (1/c)^{6 - k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Because each term in the second expression is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) that multiplies \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of coefficients is 64, as calculated earlier, then 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, as before, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all terms, including those involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it would be multiplied by the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's actually \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not a single coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. So, that seems to be the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that \\(c\\) terms must cancel out, which only happens if we're looking for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me check that.\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we want the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Hmm, that's different from 384. Now I'm confused.\n\nWait, so which is it? Is the problem asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\)? I think I need to clarify.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes a sum of terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that's not correct because the second polynomial is a separate variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the product, but it's multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. That can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, but that would require more context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the \\(c\\) part, which would be 6 times 20, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only appear in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a specific term, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that's not a single coefficient, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and then the rest is separate.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe I should consider the entire expression as a product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, I'm looking for all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the rest is separate.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, so it must involve both parts. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that maybe it's only the constant term, which would give 120. So, which is correct? Let me think again. If I expand the entire product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and then the rest is separate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times 20, giving 120.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up similar problems or recall how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find all combinations of terms from the first polynomial and the second polynomial whose variables multiply to give \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), there's no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But that's not a single coefficient, so perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient from the first part, which is 6.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient in the product, which includes both polynomials. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but as written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, perhaps the answer is 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the second polynomial is multiplied in such a way that it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient remains 6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and the second polynomial is a separate factor, then the coefficient remains 6. But that seems too simple, and I think the problem is expecting me to consider the entire product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those with \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, that seems more plausible. So, to clarify, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that would be the correct answer.\n\nLet me double-check that. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(k = 3\\), as I calculated earlier, giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire sum of coefficients, which is 64, giving 384, but that would be if I'm considering all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and consider the contributions from each part of the product.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), i.e., \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions: one involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since I'm only interested in terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, the other factors involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would just multiply that coefficient. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms. But wait, no, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so maybe the overall coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be multiplied by the corresponding term in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, actually, since I'm only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would involve the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Wait, but actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but without any conditions on \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that: if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the rest of the terms involve \\(c\\), perhaps each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be considered as a coefficient for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, yes, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion would be \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this case, if I wanted the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, in this case, the coefficients are not just 1 multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other expansion, but rather, each term in the other expansion is a separate coefficient. But in the original problem, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the product of the coefficients, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the \\(c\\) expansion is being multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But when we talk about the coefficient, we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would actually be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and since the \\(c\\) terms are separate, the coefficient would be 6, and the rest is just multiplied by the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're not considering \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply. So, for example, if you have \\((a + b)(c + d)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + d\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, in this problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which would include all the terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. The problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, maybe it's considering all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but that would require the \\(c\\) part to be \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression. That would make more sense. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) and also \\(c^0\\) in the product. So, that would require me to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. Let me try that approach. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, that would be the answer. But wait, let me check again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe it's considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm confused now because the problem might be expecting either 120 or 384. Let me see. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any specific \\(c\\) term, so it's 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how the problem is phrased. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384. But I'm still a bit unsure. Let me try to think of an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(ab\\) would also be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if someone asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient is multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the other expansion. So, applying that logic, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384. But to make sure, let me calculate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), it's 384. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), we consider the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these results gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, actually, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the entire part involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a constant factor, so I can compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps that term in the first expression is just a constant with respect to the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms.

But that doesn't seem right because the sum would be a large expression, and I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) times each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve all powers of \\(c\\). So, I think that's the case. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, the approach would be to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, it would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a^2b^2. When we multiply this by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the product would be 6a^2b^2 times each of those terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would indeed be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

When you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the terms combine. So, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, which means \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in the original problem, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I'm overcomplicating by considering \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). Hmm, so maybe I need to sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't a single number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and ignoring the second part, but that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, which would require multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the entire second expansion. But that would result in a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of the two expansions. So, that term would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because in the product, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by the entire second expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's 6 times the entire expansion, but that's not a single number. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. So, maybe that's the correct answer. Let me check again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only about the first part, but that doesn't make sense because it's given as a product. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the problem is asking for a coefficient, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. Hmm, but that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only about the first part, but that can't be because it's given as a product. Wait, perhaps the problem is a product, but the terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high, and I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a single number. So, maybe the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should just consider the first part, as the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But I'm not sure. Let me try to look for similar problems. Typically, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expansions, it's considering the term in the product, so you have to consider the product of the coefficients. So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient in the first expansion, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second expansion, but since the problem is asking for the coefficient, perhaps it's intended to consider the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, so \\(c^0\\), which would be 20, so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), so it's 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a typo, and it's meant to ask for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, the terms involving \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because we're supposed to have a numerical coefficient, not an expression with \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Because otherwise, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would indeed involve terms with \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. So, perhaps the problem is implicitly considering the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together. So, let's work on that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Let me write that out. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)) equals 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). If we consider that, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That makes more sense, because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which isn't possible for a coefficient. So, I think that's the right approach. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Let me just double-check my steps. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiply them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, maybe the second part just contributes a constant factor. Let me think.

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire sum from the second part, because each term in the second part is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) in the second part will just act as coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that would make the coefficient a sum of terms involving \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and it's asking for the coefficient of the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient could include terms with \\(c\\), which seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the terms where \\(c\\) is raised to a specific power, but it's not specified. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only considering the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, but the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a sum of terms with \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present in the product, and its coefficient will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem to be what the problem is asking. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the problem is only interested in the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a constant. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, multiply them together to get the final coefficient. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the final answer should be 120. Wait, let me double-check. The coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I didn't consider the constant term, and just multiplied the entire expansion, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the constant term in the second expansion and multiply by 6, giving 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps the answer is simply 6, because the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms.

But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just 6, and the rest is part of other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, that makes more sense. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right either. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the \\(c\\) terms, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\), so we set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each such term, we have to consider all possible \\(m\\) values from 0 to 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the sum over all \\(m\\) from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each \\(m\\), the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) is multiplied by 6, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).
