    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), which means \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nWait, but the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so when we multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well, right? But wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the two parts are \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and they are separate in terms of variables. The first part involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply them together, the variables in the first part don't interact with the variables in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that means considering the entire expression, but only looking at the terms where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, I think I need to clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would be the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any terms involving \\(c\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply for each corresponding term. But in this case, the first part has terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the variables are different, so when you multiply them, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the variables don't combine. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term from the second part, which would be terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), etc., depending on the expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would imply that we're considering the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part is a separate expression, so the overall coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that doesn't seem right because the two parts are multiplied together, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6, as I calculated earlier, because the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering all variables, but I don't think so because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^6\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^6\\) in the second part, and similarly for other terms. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering the entire expression, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because it's the only term where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are squared and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's break this down. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). \n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\). Now, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, we need to find the value of \\(m\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Let me solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). \n\nSo, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me compute it step by step: 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6\u00d76=36, so 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6 from the first expansion, and the term in the second expansion that gives \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m=3\\), which has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6\u00d720=120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through it again. \n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), correct. Then, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c\\) cancels out (i.e., exponent zero) is when \\(m=3\\), because \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) gives \\(m=3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), correct. So, when you multiply the two coefficients, 6\u00d720=120. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(c^0\\), we need the term in the second part where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, that term is when \\(c^6\\) and \\((1/c)^m\\) multiply to \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), and setting that equal to \\(c^0\\) gives \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m=3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6\u00d720=120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) for \\(a\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but hold on, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), right? So, when we multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we are only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), we need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, meaning the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term, it will still be \\(a^2b^2\\). If we multiply it by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or something, which isn't what we want.\n\nSo, let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and finding the constant term. Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by 20 (the constant term). So, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it as the product of the two expansions. Each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the constant term in the other expansion, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem.\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n3.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the way it's written, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms.

Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is expecting a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, I think that's what the problem is asking. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together. So, let's proceed with that. First, as established, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 6!/(3!3!) is 720/(6\u00d76) = 720/36 = 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the product, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6, and it's multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking. I think the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120. Wait, but let me double-check. Let me consider the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is 6a^2b^2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, that would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.

So, the coefficient is 6.\n\nWait, but the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider how the multiplication affects the coefficient?\n\nWait, no. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? Because the other part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think that term will be multiplied by every term from the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion. But wait, no, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, its coefficient in the product would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the other part.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will contribute terms that involve \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without any \\(c\\), so it would just be a constant term multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would just be 6. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too big, and I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the problem just wants the coefficient from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, which is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so in the product, it would be multiplied by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense.\n\nSo, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want this exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by 20 from the second part, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we first determine the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Does this affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6, and the rest is multiplied by some constants involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we're looking for the coefficient where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient we're looking for is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I think I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. But hold on, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when we multiply it by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the result will be a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power.

Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\), when you multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of that part, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a term involving \\(c\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a sum of coefficients, not just a single coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the other expansion, since each term in the other expansion is a constant (with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) times a power of \\(c\\). Wait, but actually, no, because each term in the other expansion is of the form \\(k c^m\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(k c^m\\), you get \\(k a^2b^2 c^m\\), which is a term in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so effectively, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, that would be the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to just consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and not worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they are separate variables. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as a product, so the variables are all part of the same expression. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the other part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form (coefficient from first part) * (coefficient from second part) * a^something * b^something * c^something. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then for each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, it will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 64. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by the term from the first expansion. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), so the answer would be 384.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c=1\\), so \\(2^6=64\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}=6\\). So, 6*64=384. That seems correct.\n\nBut another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when you expand this, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then I would have to compute the coefficient from the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) from the second part and multiply them. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), the coefficient is the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all coefficients from the second part. So, 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the expansion would be \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is not present in the product unless you have a cross term, but in reality, the product would have terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2 \\times 1/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), etc. So, actually, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no term with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that contradicts my earlier logic because in this case, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(c + 1/c\\), which when \\(c=1\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\)) times 2, which would be 2, but in reality, the product doesn't have \\(a^2b^2\\) at all. So, that suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. In the example I just considered, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the expansion is \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2ab c + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, not 1*2=2. Therefore, my earlier approach was wrong. That means that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed by multiplying terms from the two expansions unless both expansions have terms that can combine to form \\(a^2b^2\\). But in reality, the first expansion has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second expansion has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply them, you can't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check. In the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) from the product of the two expansions unless there's a term in the second expansion that can cancel out the \\(c\\) terms, which isn't possible here. So, in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot be formed because it would require that the \\(c\\) terms somehow cancel out, which they don't. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient is zero, but in the original problem, maybe it's different? Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear only if there's a term in the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, that approach gave me a wrong answer, so perhaps that's not the correct way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem didn't specify, so perhaps the correct answer is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) cannot appear without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), giving a term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all such terms would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me an incorrect result. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the coefficient is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the cross terms would involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all these terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but in my example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps the answer is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, without any \\(c\\) terms, in which case the coefficient would be zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms in the product.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps in the example, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, but in the original problem, maybe it's different. Wait, no, in the original problem, the same logic applies: the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all these terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, let's compute that. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be 6*20=120. But the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's intended to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. But since the problem didn't specify, I'm a bit confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part) times (coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part). But since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the sum over all coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6*20=120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look up how coefficients work in products of polynomials. When you have two polynomials, say P(a,b) and Q(c), their product P(a,b)Q(c) will have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, if P has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\) and Q has terms like \\(k c^m\\), then the product will have terms like \\(6k a^2b^2c^m\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from Q multiplied by the coefficient from P. So, that would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me a wrong answer, but perhaps that's because in the example, the first polynomial was of lower degree. Let me test it again. Let me take P(a,b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, and Q(c) = c + 1/c. The product is (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there's no such term. So, in this case, the coefficient is zero, not 1*(sum of coefficients in Q). So, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) without having some combination of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that requires more terms than available.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) appears multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but in my example, that approach gave me a wrong result, so perhaps the difference is that in the example, the first polynomial didn't have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the original problem, it does. Wait, no, in the example, the first polynomial was \\((a + b)^2\\), which does have a term \\(a^2b^2\\), but when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is \\(c + 1/c\\), the product doesn't have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) because all the terms involve \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. Therefore, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is also zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because in the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product, just multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial. So, in the example, the coefficient would be 1*(sum of coefficients in Q), which is 2, but the actual coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept of coefficients in the product. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial multiplied by the coefficient from the first polynomial for \\(a^2b^2\\). But in the example, that would be 1*2=2, but the actual coefficient is zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't appear. Therefore, my approach is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer must be zero because you can't form \\(a^2b^2\\) without having some \\(c\\) terms, which aren't present in the first polynomial. Wait, but that's not the case because the first polynomial is separate from the second. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, the answer is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), in which case the coefficient is 384. But in the example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, in which case the coefficient is zero because the product includes only terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is zero.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut in my example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would give 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, which would give zero. But the problem didn't specify, so perhaps the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems online or in textbooks to see how this is handled. From what I recall, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term in a product of polynomials, you consider all possible ways that term can be formed, which may involve combining terms from both polynomials. But in this case, since the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the first polynomial and doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120. But without more context, it's hard to say. However, given that the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), I think the intended answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't mention \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nBut in my earlier example, that approach gave me an incorrect result, so perhaps I'm still misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, I'm unsure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute the sum of coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). So, if I multiply that by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, I get 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Considering the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the problem is the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are only in the second part. So, when I multiply these two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). That means, when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) terms don't influence that, it's just the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it's in the product of two expressions. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get an \\(a^2b^2\\) term is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, as we found earlier. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but considering all possible terms, including those multiplied by \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term from the second expression, it would be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific monomial. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the only way to get exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. \n\nSo, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, we get \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 times the coefficient from the first part, which was 6. So, 20 times 6 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check. So, the first part gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part, when expanded, has a constant term 20. So, when we multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by 20, giving a total coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, indeed, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

But wait, that can't be, because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), then I need to find all the ways that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term in the second expansion, I get a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But that would only happen if the term in the second expansion is a constant term, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Therefore, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so let's work on that. The expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0 for the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Since these are independent, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\). When I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by the constant term, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in terms that don't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 20 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. This occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. This occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nSince we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficients from both parts:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I need to multiply by something from the second part as well? Wait, no, because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), and the first part is in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply only if the variables are the same, but here, the variables are different. Wait, let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, you'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms like \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) for various \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not any term involving \\(c\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you're adding more terms, but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not just a number. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expanded expression. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in effect, it's 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, but the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that interpretation. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. So, first, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 120. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe the coefficient is just 6, but now I'm getting 120. I think the correct approach is to consider that the entire expression is a product, so when you expand it, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n$\\boxed{120}$"

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but the problem statement just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's just the coefficient from the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, the coefficients do get scaled by the coefficients from the second expansion. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by all the terms in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe we're just looking for the coefficient in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because when you multiply, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term by itself, its coefficient would be the same as in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by the first. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, which would give \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second part. So, first, let's find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found as 6. Next, we need to find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me check that again because I might be making a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is just 6, but that seems unlikely because the entire expression is multiplied by the second part. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect it because we're considering the product as a whole. Wait, no, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Let me verify that with an example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times 1/c + b \\times c + b \\times 1/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be \\(c + 1/c\\). So, if we were to find the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product, it would be \\(c + 1/c\\), which is the same as the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part. Therefore, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem statement just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so I think it's safe to assume that we're considering the coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms, meaning that we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that again because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so when I multiply them together, it's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, when these are multiplied together, we get \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait a second, but maybe I should consider if there's any other way \\(a^2b^2\\) could appear. But no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so it can't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the only contribution is from the first part, and it's multiplied by the constant term from the second part. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So, the coefficient should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from this part is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) in the expansion because \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) would then be \\(a^{4 - 2}b^2 = a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when I multiply the two expressions, I'm just looking for the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion, I think I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part because the variables are different. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(c\\) is a different variable, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is a single term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the coefficient when considering all possible products. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, but since \\(c\\) is involved, perhaps the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, let me think again. Let me write out the entire expansion. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're looking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem doesn't specify any terms involving \\(c\\), maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of both parts. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me check that. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the entire expression is \\(A \\times B\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) is a term with coefficient 6, as we found earlier. When multiplied by \\(B\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, in the product \\(A \\times B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficient 6 times each term in \\(B\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with \\(c\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can break it down into two parts:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6.\n2. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOnce I have both coefficients, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying the exponents, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient from the second part is 20.\n\nNow, multiplying the two coefficients together: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part) equals 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't consider the \\(c^0\\) term and just multiplied the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\), but since the problem didn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, I think it's safe to assume that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\), which gives us 120 as the coefficient.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part and identifying the relevant coefficients. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nMultiplying these coefficients gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not directly, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how it interacts with the other terms. But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), right?

So, when I multiply the two parts together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from the other expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would only happen when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms in this case, right? Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\).

So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and I multiply it by a term in the second part, say \\(c^k \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{c}^{6 - k}\\), which simplifies to \\(c^{2k - 6}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term unless we're multiplying by a constant term, which would be when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me find that term. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = 20\\). Wait, let me check that calculation. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). That would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term \\(20\\) (the constant term). So, when you multiply these two, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part is multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we have to consider only the terms in the second part that are constants (i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). So, the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, I think that's correct. Let me just make sure there isn't a different approach.

Since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, only the \\(c\\) terms, so yeah, that makes sense. So, I think 120 is the right answer. Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I calculated the binomial coefficients correctly. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6.

So, let's compute the binomial coefficient for \\(k = 2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). I think \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't need to consider the other terms involving \\(c\\).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the \\(c\\) terms would add more variables. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, no, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe I need to check the problem again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, treat \\(c\\) as an independent variable, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve multiplying the coefficients from each part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem correct either because the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) would affect the overall expression. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. Since the two parts are multiplied together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), maybe I can consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient remains the same. But that can't be right because the second part is a separate expansion. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Maybe the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion. Let me see. \n\nSo, first, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found before. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0\\) is the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). So, let me compute that. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). I think that's 20 because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm interpreting the problem correctly. Let me double-check. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the expanded form, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\), where \\(k + l = 4\\) (from the first part) and \\(m\\) comes from the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, does that mean we're considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, or only the constant term? \n\nWait, no, because if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that would be 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would involve the sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would make it more complicated. But I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the constant term. \n\nWait, let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately, then multiply them together, each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be present in the first part, and when multiplied by each term in the second part, it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any \\(m\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), so it would only be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but if I consider the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the product of the coefficients from each part of the expression. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from each expansion:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\).

So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and then see how it interacts with the second part. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see which terms in the second expansion \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the product such that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the result still contains \\(a^2b^2\\).

But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term should have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be the product of the two coefficients. \n\nSo, let me first find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the overall expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) and contribute to the overall coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the expansion, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars, not expressions. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second term, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), its coefficient in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think of it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6. Then, I need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\dfrac{1}{c} = 1\\), and the expression becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each of those coefficients adds to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. But actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by any term from the second part, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, the coefficient would indeed be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so in the entire expansion, each term is of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\) for some integer \\(k\\), but the coefficient would be the same for each of these, so the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), which would be 6, but that seems unlikely because the expression includes \\(c\\). So, probably, the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6*64=384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the other expansion. So, yeah, I think 384 is the right answer. Let me just confirm. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed when \\(c=1\\), which is \\(2^6=64\\). So, 6*64=384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

But that would mean the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which seems too broad. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and then multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient in the product, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by the entire expansion, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the original problem just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, which includes all the terms from the product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which wouldn't be \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To do that, I can use the binomial theorem again. Let me write that out: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nNow, since the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6 and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of these two coefficients. That is, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expression, provided that the variables multiply in such a way that their exponents add up to the desired term. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression with the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. So, yes, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives the overall coefficient as \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, I need the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That would correspond to \\(k = 2\\) because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate that coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, right? Because 4 choose 2 is 6. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think the coefficient I just found (which is 6) will be multiplied by something from the second part. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the constant term is in the second part? Because if I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think we need to find the constant term in the second expansion because only that term won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient. So, let me check that. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient should be 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through it again. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which occurs at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when I multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, giving 6 * 20 = 120. So, yes, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"
