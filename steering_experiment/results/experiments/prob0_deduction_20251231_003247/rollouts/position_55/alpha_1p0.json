    "text": " So, the coefficient is 120. I think that's right. But wait, let me think about the structure of the problem again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from the second part. So, the product of these two terms would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\), and the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, does \\(a^2b^2\\) multiply by any other terms that could affect it? For example, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^k\\) from the second part, but since the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term in the second polynomial. Any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. Suppose I don't separate the two parts. Maybe I can think of the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would involve considering all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only be the case when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by any term from the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need the term from the second polynomial to be \\(c^0\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both polynomials completely, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6, and then each term would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's as if we're treating the second polynomial as a constant, but that's not quite accurate. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second polynomial has multiple terms, each of which would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, in that case, only the term where we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the \\(c^0\\) term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\). For example, if I take \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) from the first polynomial and \\(c^m (1/c)^{6 - m}\\) from the second, and then multiply them together, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) would be \\(k\\) and \\(4 - k\\), respectively, and the exponents of \\(c\\) would be \\(m - (6 - m) = 2m - 6\\). To get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so that's the same as before. But also, we need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the only term that contributes is when \\(k = 2\\) and \\(m = 3\\), which gives the coefficient as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\). The coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which corresponds to \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\) gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
