But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I have to multiply this expansion by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. \n\nWhen I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by each term, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will get multiplied by each term, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), it would actually be the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems off because the entire expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have terms with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\). So, unless we're looking for a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times something else, but the problem is just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\cdot 6c^5\\), and so on. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating the entire expression as a product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that can't be right because the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions, one in \\(a, b\\) and one in \\(c, 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms will be products of terms from each expansion. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, let me find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did earlier, using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\nNext, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That is, the constant term when expanding this expression. Let's think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, we can write:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expansion being a product of two independent expansions. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you have to pick \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and any term from the second part. But wait, that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, which would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if we're considering the term where the second part is 1, i.e., the constant term. So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that's the correct interpretation. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only appear if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the only way to get a term that is exactly \\(a^2b^2\\) is if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by 1, which is the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's considering the entire product and looking for terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the sum over all possible \\(k\\) of (coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in first part) multiplied by (coefficient of \\(c^{k}\\) in the second part), but that seems more complicated. But actually, no, because the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), so it's only considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let's consider the entire product: each term is a product of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). To find the coefficient of this term, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I remember that \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\dfrac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). So, plugging in the numbers, we get \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only appears in the first part, I think that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Instead, it affects the coefficients of \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a separate variable. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is multiplied by it. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first expression, and the second expression has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a constant. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, the expression is a product of two separate binomials. So, when we multiply them out, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by the entire second part. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the other variables. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term, and when multiplied by the second expression, it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times some polynomial in \\(c\\). So, does the problem mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expanded expression, treating \\(c\\) as another variable? Or is it asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some specific term in \\(c\\)? Hmm, the problem statement isn't entirely clear, but I think it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so that would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that seems like an infinite series, which doesn't make sense because the second part is a finite expansion. \n\nWait, no, actually, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a finite expansion. So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is 6 from the first part, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. Wait, but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which would include multiple terms. But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify. It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because the question is phrased as if it's expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is actually a product of two separate expansions, and we're supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which would include all the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the expansion of the second part. But that seems too involved. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would require evaluating \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) at \\(c = 1\\), which gives the sum of coefficients. Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not the sum of coefficients. \n\nWait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), has terms involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but the problem didn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe the answer is that the coefficient is 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But I think the problem expects a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but when I multiply each term by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would indeed be 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's effectively 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible terms, but without any specific \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and not considering the second part because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, let me think differently. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is phrased as if it's expecting a numerical coefficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the expansion of the second part, but if we're considering the entire product, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of it as a product of two separate polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is probably not what the problem is asking for. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire product, considering all terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, that makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, the coefficient of each resulting term would be 6 times the coefficient from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = 1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^2 + 6 \\times 20a^2b^2 + 6 \\times 15a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6 \\times 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6 \\times 1a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

But the problem is only asking about \\(a^2b^2\\), so I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make it not just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, that means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nAlright, let's tackle that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent on \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the exponent to be 0 because we're looking for the term where \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term.\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, when I multiply the two polynomials, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Because any other term in the second polynomial would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we expand:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the exponent on \\(c\\) to be 0, so we solve \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6 from the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right? So, maybe the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not multiplied by anything else. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Let me think: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it comes from a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But wait, that can't be because the second expression only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the terms in the second expression don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those multiplications. Wait, no, that's not correct because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, and when multiplied by terms from the second part, it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can exist in the product is if it's multiplied by a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second expression. Because if it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or similar, which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because that way, when you multiply 6 by that constant term, you get a term that's just \\(6 \\times \\text{constant} \\times a^2b^2\\), which would be the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not right because 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients: 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with a coefficient of 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a term with \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 \u00d7 6 = 120.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the entire product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by terms from the second expression. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression? That can't be, because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, so I think it's expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some constant, not by any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the only way that happens is if the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, which is exactly what the constant term in the second expression does. So, yeah, I think my initial reasoning is correct: the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is indeed 6. Then, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nWait another thought: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part comes from \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Then, when you multiply by the second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expression will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be present if it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. But in that case, the second part's coefficient would have to be 1, which isn't the case. So, no, that's not the right approach. The correct approach is to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expression, resulting in the coefficient being 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think I've thought this through enough. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient for that term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that as well. Hmm, does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part get multiplied by something from the second part? Let me think. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. So, expanding that would give terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}\\), \\(6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}\\), and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). \n\nBut wait, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is only in the first part. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, right? It's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all, so when multiplied by terms in \\(c\\), it'll just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times each power of \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that might not make sense because the problem is a product of two expressions, so the entire expression would have terms involving both \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\). But the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\)s. \n\nWait, actually, no, that's not correct. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), etc., each time. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually appear as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, but in the entire product, is there a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term that's \\(c^0\\), i.e., 1? Because if so, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 from the second expansion. \n\nSo, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) is when the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) balance out. Let me figure that out. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and it's \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, including the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when multiplied, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but is that the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Since the second expansion only contributes a constant term when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would involve a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\). So, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term 20. Therefore, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, if we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, for each such term, it's multiplied by each term from the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. But we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)). As we found earlier, that happens when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.

So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), that would mean \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the problem is the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here; I need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact. Hmm, but actually, when I multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. However, since the variables involved in each polynomial are different (the first has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)), the multiplication won't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the terms in the second polynomial don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when I multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is a product where each term is a term from the first expansion times a term from the second expansion. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m \\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can ignore the terms from the second polynomial that don't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I take 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), that would give me a term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But actually, the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. \n\nBut wait, no. Let me clarify: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, you just get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, and since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire second polynomial. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product. So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second part. \n\nBut actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient remains the same as in the first part. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply by a polynomial that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain unchanged. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by each term in the first. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is being multiplied term by term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. \n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which has a coefficient of 6) is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) will have a coefficient of 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself doesn't exist in the product unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way to get a term with just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. \n\nOh, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nHow do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? Again, I can use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which is at \\(k = 3\\), and its coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Since the variables in the two polynomials are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Simplifying the coefficients, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original problem isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression. Hmm, but I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Or do I? Wait, no, actually, when I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, I think that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would create terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the original question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the coefficient is a number, but the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, actually, I think the question is asking for the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because each term in the expansion would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, maybe the question is only considering the term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and it's okay if there are \\(c\\) terms attached to it. But then, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating all variables as separate. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the problem is just \\((a + b)^4\\), but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when the entire expression is expanded, but considering only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, leaving a constant term. That is, if we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the term is just a number, and then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in that term. Hmm, that might make sense.\n\nWait, let me think. So, if I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by this constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, maybe that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the idea is that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only term that contributes to a constant term (i.e., without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by the constant term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term in \\(c\\), would be 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nSo, to recap: In \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Therefore, when multiplying these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me see if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could consider the entire product and look for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would involve finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, and then multiplying by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, giving 120. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), that would be a different matter, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, making it a constant term. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculation for the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). To get the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that part is correct.\n\nAnd in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any other way this could be interpreted. Suppose the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But then, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for some \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So, if we're just looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), then \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so that the coefficient is a number. Therefore, the answer is 120.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).

Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial.

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\), which simplifies to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).

    "text": " Let me write that expansion out.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, that becomes:\n\\[\n1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\n\\]\nSo, looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can see it's 6. So, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), does that mean that the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Oh, I see. So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), might contribute some coefficients that multiply with the first part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, I might not need to consider the second expansion at all.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Because the entire expression is the product of both expansions, so when we multiply them together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would mean that in the second expansion, the term must be a constant, right? Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by some term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that would change the variables, but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because when you multiply the two expressions together, any term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second. So, if I want the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it must come from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if I take a term from the second part that has \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nSo, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's expand that using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\nSo, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is 0, meaning that term is the constant term.\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nSo, the constant term in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (the constant term in the second expansion).\n\nSo, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, I have two separate expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them together, the terms will combine, but since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from the second expansion. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to double-check, let me think about the expansion again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, for example, the \\(a^4\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, the \\(a^3b\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(a^3bc^4\\), etc. But the only term that would result in just \\(a^2b^2\\) is when we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, yes, that gives us \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Therefore, we multiply the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, that's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that means I need to consider the product of these two expansions. Hmm, so I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient where the variables \\(a^2b^2\\) appear. But in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), there are no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. It's only in terms of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, but in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just get multiplied by all the terms in the second polynomial, but the coefficient will be the sum of all those products. Hmm, no, actually, since the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each of those products will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the expansion of the second part is a sum of terms with \\(c\\), so if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, in the entire expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^k\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) has a coefficient that includes the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) and the coefficient from \\(c^k\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean I have to sum over all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first expansion. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) be 6 times 64, which is 384? Hmm, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times 64, as I thought earlier. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, yes, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2, because \\(c + 1/c\\) evaluated at \\(c=1\\) is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2. So, in this case, the coefficient of each term in the first expansion is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 2. So, yes, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check the second expansion again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, each term would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, I just multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which gives me 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for a specific \\(k\\), then I would have to find the product of the coefficients from each part for that specific \\(k\\). But since it's only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, I think the approach is correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, find the sum of all its coefficients by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64.\n\n3. Multiply the two results together: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe I can consider the entire product as a product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6, but with specific exponents depending on the binomial expansions.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first expansion, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Then, in the second expansion, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're multiplying by \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum over all \\(m\\) of the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Wait, but that's the same as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, yes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think in terms of generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which again gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " \n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared. That should be when \\(k = 2\\) because in the binomial expansion, the exponent of \\(b\\) is \\(k\\), and the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\). So, if \\(k = 2\\), then the term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is the number of combinations of 4 things taken 2 at a time. I think that's 6, because 4! / (2! * 2!) = (24)/(2 * 2) = 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then multiply them together? Or is there a way to just focus on the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and not worry about the other variables? Hmm, maybe I can separate the two expansions because they involve different variables. \n\nSo, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, right? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient should just be 6 times whatever the expansion of the second part is, but actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient in the product would just be 6 times the entire second expansion, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion includes terms with \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term, \\(a^2b^2\\), is present in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) as 6\\(a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is affected when multiplied by the other expansion. However, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so when we multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), does that mean we just take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part? Or do we have to consider only the constant term from the second expansion?\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be present in the expansion as \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, each term in the second expansion is something like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all terms from the second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the second expansion isn't a single term. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nHold on, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not an expression involving \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. It says, \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would include terms from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a number. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you expand the entire expression, collect all terms that have \\(a^2b^2\\) and sum their coefficients. But since the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by each term from the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning that it doesn't involve any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) because that would be the term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we would need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nThat makes more sense. So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The product of these two will give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, assuming that the constant term is the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains as \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't be pure \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term contributing to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is when the second part contributes a constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means I need to find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears. \n\nUsing the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, for \\(a^2b^2\\), I need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). Let me check that: if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). \n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just the first part. That means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) with the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nHmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. \n\nWait, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) and it's being multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply for each corresponding term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression, which is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial would be 6 times each term in the second polynomial. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any other term involving \\(c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\) as well, which wouldn't just be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nThat makes more sense. So, first, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to be 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). \n\nMultiplying them together, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is indeed 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, to summarize, I first found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, then found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiplied them together to get the final coefficient in the product.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We seek the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), giving \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient here is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of these two binomials. I'm supposed to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and then see how it interacts with the second part. \n\nSince the two parts are multiplied together, the entire term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term from the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with \\(c\\), the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient in front of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient remains 6. \n\nBut hold on, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are separate. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only appear in the first part, and the second part will contribute a factor that's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6, as calculated before. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I need to consider something else. Let me check. Suppose I have two separate expansions: one for \\((a + b)^4\\) and another for \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's as if we're treating \\(a^2b^2\\) as a single term and collecting all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and when multiplied by any term in the second part, it becomes \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) [some term in \\(c\\)]. So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in multiple terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, because the second part when expanded includes a constant term (when the exponents cancel out). \n\nWait, let's think about \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The expansion of this will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), in steps of 2. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the constant term, where the exponent is 0, occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all terms from the second part, including the constant term 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 120. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me clarify: If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then yes, it's 6 * 20 = 120. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be different. But the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\). So, I think it's correct that the coefficient is 120. \n\nLet me verify that again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, making the coefficient 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I consider the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all terms where the product contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the only contribution comes from the constant term in the second expansion. So, 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), I need to find the term where the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. Let me recall the binomial coefficients. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\), right? So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\).

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think that after expanding both parts, I need to multiply them together. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the other terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)?\n\nLet me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).

So, does that mean that any term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (positive or negative) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Because when you multiply, the exponents add up. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiply by \\(c^k\\) from the second part, the term will be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we are looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, but the exponents of \\(c\\) can be anything. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) (including \\(c^0 = 1\\)).\n\nBut wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean I need to consider all terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what the \\(c\\) part is. So, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply, the variables are separate. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product. That makes more sense because then the coefficient would be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, first, as I calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, it's 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by the \\(c^0\\) term from the second polynomial. So, that's why it's just 6 * 20.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me write out the general term again: \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, for \\(k = 0\\), it's \\(c^6\\), \\(k = 1\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(k = 2\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(k = 3\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(k = 4\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(k = 5\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(k = 6\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, yes, the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(k = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is indeed 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I misinterpreted it. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), considering that the other terms might have \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but since \\(c\\) is a separate variable, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any reference to \\(c\\). So, perhaps the problem is considering \\(c\\) as a separate variable, and the coefficient is just 6, because when you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would be more than just 6.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written in a way that \\(c\\) is another variable, and we are to treat \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a number. So, I think the correct interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 (c + d)^1\\). If I'm asked for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\), it would be 2 * (c + d), because each term in \\(a + b\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(c + d\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2*(c + d). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). However, in the original problem, the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), so when you ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps it's expecting a numerical coefficient, meaning that \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restriction on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6*(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6). So, that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so I think that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying anything about \\(c\\), but given that the answer is a number, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), then the answer would be 6 * coefficient of \\(c^k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's safe to assume that it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, in conclusion, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out: \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider that second part. Hmm, but the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I can ignore the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think.\n\nActually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression, and then sum up all those coefficients. But wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only a part of the first expression, and the second expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means, in the product, the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will only come from the first expression, and the exponent of \\(c\\) will come from the second expression.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it doesn't matter what the \\(c\\) terms are because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. But wait, that can't be right because the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), so it's not a constant. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is not just a single number, but a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers only to the part involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the expression is a product of two expressions involving different variables. So, actually, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by each term in the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is not a single number but a Laurent polynomial. However, the problem is asking for \"the coefficient,\" implying a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the question is asking for that polynomial. But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, it's considering all variables. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), and specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expression multiplied by 6.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. But I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient in the context of all variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But the problem doesn't specify any \\(c\\) terms, so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you expand \\((a + b)^4\\), you get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is a separate variable. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, would the coefficient be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\)? But that seems like a stretch because the problem isn't asking for the sum of coefficients, but specifically the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is different, the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, it's in the context of all variables. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it and the answer is just 6.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me think about how the product works. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be the coefficient, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient,\" which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved for a problem that's likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient as a numerical value, considering that the second part might have a specific term that cancels out the \\(c\\) terms, but I don't see how. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the second part is raised to the 6th power, but that doesn't directly affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that.\n\nSo, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), which would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a Laurent polynomial. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, then it's just 6. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by all possible \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a polynomial, not a single number.\n\nWait, maybe I should look back at the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes \\(c\\) terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is a separate expression. But that doesn't seem right because the entire product's coefficients would be products of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two expressions, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms come only from the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms come only from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a term, it's expecting a numerical value, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a numerical value. So, let's try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I calculated earlier, that's 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a Laurent polynomial. Since the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, I think the intended interpretation is that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a single coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire product's coefficients are products of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would indeed be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it stands, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\).\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's definitely two separate expressions multiplied together. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is a separate expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, which seems complicated for a problem that's likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended answer is just 6, but that doesn't seem right because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, each term is multiplied by every term in the other expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not exactly right because the second expansion isn't just a sum of coefficients; it's a Laurent polynomial.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are irrelevant because they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is indeed \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the \\(c\\) term, I think the intended answer is 6, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check online or in a textbook to see if there's a standard approach to such problems. From what I recall, when you have a product of two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by the entire other expression. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But if the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting just 6, but that seems incorrect because the entire product's coefficients involve the second expression.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem is a misstatement, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^{10}\\) or something similar, but as it is, it's \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems like a stretch because the problem isn't asking for the sum of the coefficients, but the coefficient of a specific term.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion. But that's a Laurent polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting just 6, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, so if I need to write it out, it would be \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\), which is \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). But that seems too involved for a problem that's likely expecting a numerical answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from the first part, 6, because the second part is a separate expression. But that seems incorrect because the product's coefficients are products of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but it's written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\). In that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be different, but as it stands, I think the intended answer is 6, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the second part is a separate variable, so the coefficient is 6. But that seems too simplistic, and I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's a Laurent polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for similar problems. From what I recall, when you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one variable is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the entire second polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's a Laurent polynomial, which seems complicated for a problem that's likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is miswritten, or I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the answer is just 6 because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that seems incorrect because the second part is part of the product.\n\nWait, another approach: let me compute the entire product and see what the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is. So, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6})\\). So, that's \\(6c^6 + 36c^4 + 90c^2 + 120 + 90c^{-2} + 36c^{-4} + 6c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is this entire expression. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient,\" which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, that's the answer. But if it's asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's expecting just 6, but that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. So, maybe that's the intended answer. Let me check that.\n\nYes, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120. So, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify the \\(c^0\\) term, just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe the answer is 6 times the entire second expansion, but that's a Laurent polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just 6, but that seems too simplistic.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c + 1/c)^6\\), but as it is, it's two separate expressions multiplied together. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a Laurent polynomial. But the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer, so perhaps the intended answer is 6, but that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a Laurent polynomial, so the answer is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

So, perhaps the problem is expecting just 6, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the answer is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems like a stretch because the problem isn't asking for the sum of the coefficients, but the coefficient of a specific term.\n\nWait, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we also consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so let's focus on \\((a + b)^4\\) first. I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I want the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to both be 2, so that means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). \n\nSo, plugging in \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2}\\). Let me calculate \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). That's \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nWait, but the original expression is the product of two binomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how these two parts interact. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I should note that \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) are separate variables from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). \n\nIn other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the part involving \\(c\\) will just contribute a factor that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that means we need to consider all possible terms from the second expansion and sum up their contributions to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when we multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), does that mean we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion and then multiply by the coefficient from the first part? Or is there another way?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to clarify. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), where \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) are integers from 0 to 4 and 0 to 6 respectively. \n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from when \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, as we found earlier. The coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, each of these terms will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The second part, when expanded, has terms of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), since \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = c^{-m}\\), so each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m - m} = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, when we multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) (which has coefficient 6) by each term in the second expansion, we get terms of the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the sum of all these coefficients, right? Because each term in the second expansion contributes a factor that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum all these contributions?\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\)'s power, that would imply we're summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. But in reality, each term in the expansion will have both \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with positive and negative exponents of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps we need to consider all possible terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) part. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and each of those terms has a coefficient that contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nBut wait, let's think about it differently. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. When you multiply them, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means we're considering all possible combinations where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts multiply to \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as we found earlier. Now, we need to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial, we can substitute \\(c = 1\\). So, let's compute \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because when I substitute \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 64. So, when I multiply each term in the first expansion by each term in the second, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. That seems high, but let's verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would be different because then we would only consider the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, which would come from the middle term of the second expansion.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean we're summing over all possible terms where the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are \\(a^2b^2\\), and the \\(c\\) parts can be anything. Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be obtained by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial with any term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, yes, that would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a coefficient that gets multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). The sum of all coefficients is indeed \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\), as we calculated earlier. So, when we multiply this by \\(a^2b^2\\), each coefficient in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the middle term. Let's see.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nBut the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), so I think it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 384. But to be sure, let me check both interpretations.\n\nIf the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the answer is 384. If it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), the answer is 120. Since the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), I think the first interpretation is correct, so the answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then we're considering all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), and each of those terms contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the total coefficient is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second polynomial. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), we sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 384. Let me just recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the sum of all coefficients in this expansion, substitute \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from both parts:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

But in this case, since I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then it would be a sum, not a single coefficient.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when I multiply this by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in that expansion will be multiplied by 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. If I have two terms, say, 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 and then another term, say, \\(d c^k\\), then when I multiply them, I get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 d c^k. But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), I think I might have misunderstood the problem. Wait, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, each term in the product will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). But the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I take 6 times 64, that would be 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I think the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only be multiplied by each term in the expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient in the other expansion, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to form that specific term. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and each term in the second polynomial is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). So, when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only be the case if there's a term where the powers of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, actually, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that, when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\), would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) alone.\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k - k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When you multiply these two, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. The only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial, which has a coefficient of 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I was confused earlier about whether I needed to consider all the terms, but actually, only the constant term in the second polynomial affects the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me write that out. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) would expand to \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, that would be \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by another expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nNow, since multiplication distributes over addition, I can think of each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I can focus on the term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that is \\(6a^2b^2\\) and then see what happens when it's multiplied by the other expression.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would come from the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), plus any other terms that might result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their exponents won't affect the exponents of \\(c\\). So, actually, when multiplying, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the exponents of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the \\((a + b)^4\\) expansion. When I multiply it by the entire \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, it will be multiplied by each term in that expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables, their exponents won't combine with those of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by each term in the \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expansion, but the exponent of \\(c\\) won't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change, but the coefficient gets multiplied by the coefficient from the second polynomial.\n\nWait, let me check that. Suppose I have two polynomials: \\(P(a, b) = p_0 + p_1a + p_2b + p_3a^2 + p_4ab + p_5b^2 + \\dots\\) and \\(Q(c) = q_0 + q_1c + q_2c^2 + \\dots\\). Then, the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would be \\(p_0q_0 + p_0q_1c + p_0q_2c^2 + \\dots + p_1q_0a + p_1q_1ac + p_1q_2ac^2 + \\dots + p_2q_0b + p_2q_1bc + \\dots\\). So, in this product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But in \\(P(a, b)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a constant term with respect to \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it becomes \\(p_{a^2b^2} \\times (q_0 + q_1c + q_2c^2 + \\dots)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(p_{a^2b^2} \\times (q_0 + q_1 + q_2 + \\dots)\\). But wait, no, because each term in \\(Q(c)\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(p_{a^2b^2} \\times q_0 + p_{a^2b^2} \\times q_1c + p_{a^2b^2} \\times q_2c^2 + \\dots\\), but in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms would just be \\(p_{a^2b^2} \\times q_0\\). Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times (q_0 + q_1c + q_2c^2 + \\dots)\\), which is \\(a^2b^2q_0 + a^2b^2q_1c + a^2b^2q_2c^2 + \\dots\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first term, which is \\(a^2b^2q_0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(p_{a^2b^2} \\times q_0\\). \n\nWait, but that seems contradictory to my initial thought. Let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the variables. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(Q(c)\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a coefficient in the product because \\(c\\) is another variable. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we need to consider all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but in reality, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate term and when multiplied by \\(Q(c)\\), it just scales it by the entire \\(Q(c)\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you distribute, each term in \\(Q(c)\\) adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if I denote the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\) as \\(Q(1)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times Q(1)\\).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because \\(Q(1)\\) is the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). \n\nBut let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But actually, no, because when you multiply by the entire expansion, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you distribute, each term \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) is multiplied by each term \\(c^m\\) or \\(c^{-(6 - m)}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be \\(6\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, to find the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when I multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part is a monomial in \\(c\\). So, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But actually, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But no, that's not correct because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, but the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the second polynomial is in a different variable. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of it as two separate polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and one in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, the resulting polynomial will have terms that are products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and any term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method. Alternatively, I can expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them, but that would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products of coefficients from each polynomial that result in \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial is in \\(c\\), which is a different variable, the exponents of \\(c\\) don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire term, it's just \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, it has terms like \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, I get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2, a^2b^2c^{-2}, a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, which is 6, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is the middle term. \n\nWait, that's a different approach. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when expanded. So, let's calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's not just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Instead, since the variables are separate, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term with a positive or negative exponent of \\(c\\), you'll get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which has an exponent of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would only come from the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the 0 power, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) in it, which isn't part of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second polynomial, but since the second polynomial has terms with \\(c\\) in them, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, in the first polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 384, but that was because I mistakenly thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. But that's incorrect because the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is the value when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, but that would give the sum of all terms in the second polynomial, including those with \\(c\\) exponents. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) exponents, we need to consider only the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20.\n\nTherefore, the correct coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of it differently. Suppose I expand both polynomials separately and then multiply them. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\), which as we saw, has \\(6a^2b^2\\). The second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms with various powers of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, I get \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 + 6a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present as \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (the constant term), so the coefficient is 6. But wait, no, because the constant term is 20, not 1. Wait, no, in the second polynomial, the constant term is 20, so when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, I get \\(120a^2b^2\\). The other terms would be \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is non-zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 384 was correct, but that was a mistake. So, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense now. So, the correct coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

That means I need to find the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, is that correct? Or do I need to consider something else?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean I need to sum all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)?\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Let me think again. The entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes its own coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second expansion. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. Suppose I have \\( (a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 \\). Let's denote \\(P = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(Q = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m\\) or \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{-m}\\) for different values of \\(k\\) and \\(m\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(Q\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P \\times Q\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nBut wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from Q}\\). So, each term in \\(Q\\) is of the form coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), the resulting terms are \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{coefficient} \\times c^{-k}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(Q\\), each multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\)). \n\nWait, but that seems a bit off. Let me think differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\). Because each term in \\(Q\\) is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in \\(Q\\), and then adding them all together. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\).\n\nBut wait, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). Because when \\(c = 1\\), \\(c + 1/c = 2\\), so \\(Q\\) becomes \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. So, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me verify that. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(Q\\), which includes different powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q\\) multiplied by 6. Because each term in \\(Q\\) contributes its coefficient to the product term \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{term from Q}\\). So, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in Q). \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(Q\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient part, not the variables, we can consider that as 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q\\). \n\nSo, let's compute the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\). As I thought earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\(Q = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think of a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check that by expanding:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b / c\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients of \\(a\\) are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient for \\(a\\) is 1 + 1 = 2, same for \\(b\\). So, that seems correct. So, in that case, the method works. \n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, and the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4. Let's check:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\nMultiply by \\(c + 1/c\\):\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2 c + a^2 / c + 2ab c + 2ab / c + b^2 c + b^2 / c\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\) are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), the coefficient is 2 * (1 + 1) = 4, and for \\(b^2\\), it's 2. So, yes, that method works. \n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\) is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation. 6 * 64 is 384? Yes, because 6 * 60 = 360 and 6 * 4 = 24, so 360 + 24 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute it another way. Let me think of the product as two separate expansions and see how the terms combine. \n\nSo, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has coefficient 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The coefficient of each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\), and the power of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). \n\nSo, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum over all \\(k\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). \n\nWait, but that's the same as 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(6\\). And the sum of the binomial coefficients \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials and use the concept of coefficients. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, each term contributes its coefficient to the product term. \n\nSo, in this case, the first polynomial's coefficient is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me just make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that the terms from the second polynomial could affect the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\)? No, because the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will remain \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, but scaled by the coefficients from the second polynomial. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by substituting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n3. Multiply these two results: 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nI think that's solid. I've checked it multiple ways, and each time I get 384. So, I feel confident that 384 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting the variable with 1.

Now, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is the third term, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, let me think.\n\nI think so because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second part. But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply for each corresponding term. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion. So, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), right? So, when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to find the terms in the second expansion that are constants, i.e., terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is a constant. So, only the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will introduce some power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term to something like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't what we're looking for.\n\nSo, the key is to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once I find that, I can multiply it by 6, and that will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nAlright, so let me focus on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem tells us that:\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the exponents, we have:\n\n\\[\nc^{6 - k} \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^k} = c^{6 - k - k} = c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe are looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. Let's compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3! \\times (6 - 3)!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on, that calculation seems off. Let me check again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 720 / 36, which is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion gets multiplied by 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply these two parts together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the constant term from the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, multiplying 6 by 20 gives 120, which is the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to ensure I didn't make a mistake. So, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Calculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) gives 20, which is correct. So, 6 * 20 is 120, which seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I consider the product, the terms will be the product of terms from each expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion and multiply it by the constant term from the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term's variables beyond \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another thought: is it possible that when I multiply the two expansions, other terms could combine in a way that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving \\(c\\)? For example, maybe a term with \\(a^3b\\) multiplied by a term with \\(1/c\\) and another term with \\(c\\), but that seems complicated. But actually, since the two polynomials are multiplied together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to have a term from the first polynomial that is \\(a^2b^2\\) and a term from the second polynomial that is \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, you would have some \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor. Therefore, only the constant term in the second expansion will contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, I think my initial reasoning was correct.\n\nJust to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by the corresponding binomial coefficients. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, when I multiply these two expansions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, the only term among these that is \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\)) is when we multiply by the constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we start by expanding each part separately using the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\):\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the binomial coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we find \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
