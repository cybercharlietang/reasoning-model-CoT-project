    "text": " Let me try expanding that.\n\nSo, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the expansion would be:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\nCalculating the binomial coefficients:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\)\n\nSo, the expansion becomes:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nAlright, so I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That means I have to multiply the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Let me think about that.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, even though I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), I have to consider how it interacts with the other terms. But actually, no, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, but since the expression also includes \\(c\\) terms, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they want the coefficient of the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), but the rest can have any power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when we multiply out the entire expression, we'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and each of these will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) is another variable, the coefficient would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from the first expansion). Wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each would contribute to a different term. So, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems incorrect because each term in the second expansion has a different power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), so the coefficient for each specific \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a term without \\(c\\), but in the product, it's multiplied by terms that have \\(c\\), so perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, to find that, I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term, and then multiply it by 6, the coefficient from the first expansion.\n\nLet me verify that. So, if I'm looking for the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, that would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) cancel each other out. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to have \\(c^0\\), we need \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by 20 from the second expansion, giving a total coefficient of \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual because coefficients are typically constants. So, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when I expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion with coefficient 6, and it gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), meaning that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering \\(c\\), which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because the coefficient is supposed to be a single number. So, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n\nThen, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nTo find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in the second expansion is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is multiplied by it, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But that's not correct because the second polynomial isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to consider that each term in the product is a combination of terms from both polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem is written correctly. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve considering all possible terms from the second polynomial. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is unusual. So, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and not considering the second polynomial at all. But that seems unlikely because the second polynomial is part of the product.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not typical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in even steps. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each possible \\(c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number, so it's not likely.\n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering only the constant term with respect to \\(c\\), is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but to double-check, let me consider the entire expansion. The product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^5\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right) + 15c^4\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^2 + 20c^3\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 + 15c^2\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^4 + 6c\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^5 + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, the terms are:\n\n- \\(k=0\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 = 1 \\times c^6\\)\n- \\(k=1\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^{4} = 6c^4\\)\n- \\(k=2\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^{2} = 15c^2\\)\n- \\(k=3\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(k=4\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^{-2} = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(k=5\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^{-4} = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(k=6\\): \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^{-6} = 1c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which is:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) will be 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) will be 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) will be 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) will be 6 * 20 = 120, and so on for the negative powers of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually part of a larger expression where it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is not a single number but a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which is ambiguous. It could mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120, or it could mean the entire coefficient polynomial, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if the problem was written correctly. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps the answer is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of coefficients is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384, which is a constant, but that seems high. Wait, but let me think.\n\nIf I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 * 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that's if we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), treating \\(c\\) as 1. But that doesn't make sense because the original expression has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it's a Laurent polynomial, not a standard polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial, so the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is usually a number, so I think the intended answer is 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), in which case the answer is 120.\n\nWait, to confirm, let me consider the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a Laurent polynomial. But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120. If it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a Laurent polynomial, but that's not a single number. Therefore, the intended answer is likely 120.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the problem is intended to have the variables \\(a, b, c\\) all multiplied together, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of a term that includes \\(c\\). So, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), but that's not specified. However, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's safe to assume that it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I conclude that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both expansions.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero), which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). The constant term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the constant term from the second expansion:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the entire expression is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\n\\]\n\nBut the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, hold on. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, right? So, when we multiply by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves variables c and 1/c, how does that affect the term \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nI think that when you multiply two expressions together, the terms multiply term by term. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c, the variables c and 1/c won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving c or 1/c, you'll end up with terms that have c in them, but \\(a^2b^2\\) itself is a separate term without c. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms. Hmm, no, actually, I think I might be misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all the terms, but perhaps considering c terms as well? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of c. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems a bit off.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second polynomial that don't involve a or b, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is already fixed. Wait, but \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so when you multiply by the second part, which is in terms of c, the variables are separate. So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve c, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is simply the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a specific coefficient, not a sum. So, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of c is zero. Because otherwise, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just have a coefficient that's a polynomial in c, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where c cancels out. That makes more sense.\n\nSo, to clarify, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the expansion. So, in other words, when we multiply the two expansions together, we're looking for the term where the power of c is zero, which would be the constant term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That seems more reasonable.\n\nSo, let me break it down. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already did: it's 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Once we have both coefficients, we can multiply them together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is just \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nOkay, so let's tackle the second part: the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, we can use the binomial theorem for this. The binomial expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of c is 0, so we set the exponent equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (times \\(c^0\\)) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient is indeed the product of the two coefficients: 6 from the first expansion and 20 from the second. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that multiply together to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial and \\(c^0\\) is only from the second polynomial, there's only one product contributing to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 times 20. So, yes, 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Simplifying the coefficients, that would be \\(1a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + 1b^4\\). Okay, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6. Got that.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient we just found. Wait, but the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the other terms in the expansion beyond \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but actually, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we need to consider how the second part affects the coefficient.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me think again. The second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), we don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because they won't affect the power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.\n\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), as the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems like it would make the coefficient a sum over all possible terms from the second expansion. But that can't be right because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term can come from any term in the first expansion that is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and the second part is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds that coefficient as a multiplier to \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (the coefficient from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so every term in the second part will just multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), because that makes each term just its coefficient. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, so each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only term in the first part that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the \\(6a^2b^2\\) term, and when multiplied by the entire second expansion, it just scales the coefficient by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. So yes, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. Let me do that to check. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{1} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{2} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{4} = 15\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{5} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{6}{6} = 1\\). Adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, that's correct, the sum is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and when we multiply by the second part, which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), each term in the second part is just a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient, and all those terms would be part of the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be the sum of all those products, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part. But in this case, since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just scaling the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, another way: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(a^{4 - k}b^k \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, to get the term \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives the coefficient from the first part as \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, the second part contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), and the term would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) which is 6, and the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is 64, so 6*64 is indeed 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion can be found by substituting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   This means the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Since each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

That means the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Wait, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6, right? Because when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^{2}b^{2}\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, that's the coefficient from the first part.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Because the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. So, when I multiply them together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, adding their coefficients. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering any \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, I think the coefficient remains 6 because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second.

But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe it's just 6 times the entire second expansion's constant term, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in a binomial expansion is found by setting the variable to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because the problem isn't asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any \\(c\\) terms; it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part will be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, if the second part has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might be misapplying the concept.\n\nWait, another approach: The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^{k} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). So, for each such term, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), but we also have to consider the \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think we just sum over all possible \\(m\\), because each \\(m\\) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) with different powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\), so maybe I need to sum over all \\(m\\) the coefficients from the second part, multiplied by the coefficient from the first part.\n\nWait, but that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because for each term in the second expansion, it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem might be considering only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a specific term in the second expansion, but I think no, because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, every term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, and not worrying about the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, in other words, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is 1. Now, if I look for the coefficient of \\(a^1\\), it would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 1 + 1 = 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) would be 2. So, in this case, yes, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (sum of coefficients in the second part). So, that seems to confirm that the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, applying this to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) times 64 (sum of coefficients in the second part), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the second part doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let me first compute the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately.\n\nFor \\((a + b)^4\\), as I did before, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nFor \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), using the binomial theorem, it's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then we would have to find the specific term where \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) where \\(6 - 2m = k\\). But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient is the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the product, each term is a combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then yes, it's 6 times the sum of coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term independent of \\(c\\), so we need to find the term where \\(c^0\\) as well. So, that would be the constant term in the second expansion. Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. So, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 384, and now I'm thinking it's 120. Which one is correct? Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you have a product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the sum of the products of the coefficients of that term with all terms in the other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then it would be 6 * 20 = 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with a simpler example to confirm. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is also 2. So, that makes sense because the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), so the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2.\n\nSimilarly, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), then \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nTherefore, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes in problems, they might consider the term as a single entity, but I think in this case, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the problem is intended to only consider the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expansion, so the coefficient is 6. But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by the second expansion, each term is multiplied by all terms in the second expansion, so the coefficient should be scaled by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, another way: Let's consider the entire product as two separate parts. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which has coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, the total coefficient contributed by \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the coefficients. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. Recognize that the entire expression is a product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n3. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, right? Because the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That makes sense because if \\(k = 2\\), then \\(4 - 2 = 2\\).

But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider the second part when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. Wait, no, actually, the \\(c\\) terms are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when I multiply them, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by each term of the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not involving \\(c\\), perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because when you multiply by 1 (from the second part's expansion), it remains the same. Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), perhaps we just need to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that's not correct because each term in the second part would contribute to different terms in the product. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\), and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible coefficients that multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), etc. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate variables. Therefore, there's no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\); instead, every term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will have some power of \\(c\\) attached. So, maybe the coefficient is zero.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because if you consider the product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, which includes a \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) term. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't present in the product; instead, it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be zero because there's no term without \\(c\\) attached. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for it, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., but the coefficient for each of these would be 6 times the respective coefficient from the second part. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second part. But if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) terms, then that would only be possible if \\(k=0\\), meaning the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term where \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant term, which would be a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, now I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum over all terms where the product of the terms from each polynomial gives \\(a^2b^2\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. So, that's consistent with what I did before.\n\nSo, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the entire expression is a product of two binomial expansions. That means I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply together. But I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so does that mean that the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), right?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all possible products where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) add up to 2 each, and the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) can be anything because I'm not interested in their coefficients. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficients for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by something, the coefficient of a term not involving those variables is just the product of the coefficients.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me break it down. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Because when you multiply by the entire second expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part adds a different power of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first part is being multiplied by each term in the second part, so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, but the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of its coefficients, I can set \\(c = 1\\), because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into the expression gives the sum of the coefficients. So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and when you multiply it by the entire second expression, you get 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 times (c + 1/c)^6. So, the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in (c + 1/c)^6, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables in the two polynomials don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part.\n\nWait, but actually, in the product, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial multiplied by any term in the second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient in the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nBut since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the second part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're not interested in the exponent of \\(c\\), we just need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\), as before.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, some terms could combine to affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? For example, if the second polynomial had a term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) would change the exponent of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), but in this case, the second polynomial only has \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so it doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, every term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will still result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), just multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me do a quick sanity check. Let's consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in the product should be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's expand it: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. So, the terms involving \\(a\\) are \\(a c\\) and \\(a/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2, which is 1 * 2. That checks out.\n\nAnother example: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is 1, and the sum of coefficients in the second part is 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product should be 1 * 4 = 4. Let's see: \\((a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^2 = c\u00b2 + 2 + 1/c\u00b2\\). Multiplying, the \\(a\u00b2\\) term would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a\u00b2c\u00b2 + 2a\u00b2 + a\u00b2/c\u00b2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) is 2 (from the constant term) times 1 (from \\(a\u00b2\\)) plus the other terms, but wait, no, actually, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in the product would be the sum of the coefficients from each multiplication. Wait, actually, when you multiply \\(a\u00b2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you get \\(a\u00b2c\u00b2\\), \\(2a\u00b2\\), and \\(a\u00b2/c\u00b2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 2. But according to my earlier logic, it should be 1 (coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in first part) times 4 (sum of coefficients in second part) = 4. But in reality, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in the product is 2, not 4. So, my earlier logic is flawed.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in the product is 2, but according to my earlier method, it should be 1 * 4 = 4. So, my approach was wrong. That means I need to rethink this.\n\nSo, where did I go wrong? Let me analyze this example. In \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in the product is 2, but according to my earlier logic, it should be 1 * 4 = 4. So, my initial approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, so what's the correct way? Let me think again. When I multiply \\((a + b)^2\\) by \\((c + 1/c)^2\\), each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a\u00b2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, giving \\(a\u00b2c\u00b2\\), \\(2a\u00b2\\), and \\(a\u00b2/c\u00b2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 2, which comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2c\u00b2\\) is 1, and the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2/c\u00b2\\) is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) (without considering \\(c\\)) is 2, which is the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 2, multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a\u00b2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 1, giving 2.\n\nWait, so that suggests that the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, the only term that contributes to \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when you multiply by the constant term in the second polynomial.\n\nWait, but in the first example I did earlier, when I had \\((a + b) \\times (c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) was 2, which is the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial (which is 2) times the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the first polynomial (which is 1), giving 2. But in the second example, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first polynomial (1) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, so maybe the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) in the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, only the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^k b^{n - k}\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, in the first example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 1 * 2 = 2. In the second example, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\((c + 1/c)^2\\) is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 * 2 = 2.\n\nWait, so in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, let's calculate that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me test this with the second example again. In \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which is 1 (from the first polynomial) times 2 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial). So, that works. So, in the original problem, the coefficient should be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so why did I get 384 earlier? Because I was mistakenly multiplying by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, but that's not correct. The correct approach is to multiply by the coefficient of the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20.\n\nSo, the correct coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me confirm this with another example to make sure. Let's take \\((a + b)^3 \\times (c + 1/c)^3\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in the first polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\). The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is \\(\\dbinom{3}{1} = 3\\), since \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) when \\(m = 3/2\\), which isn't an integer, so wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), the expansion is \\(c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0, because there's no constant term. Wait, but that can't be right because \\((c + 1/c)^3\\) does have a constant term? Wait, no, let me calculate it properly.\n\nWait, \\((c + 1/c)^3 = c^3 + 3c^2*(1/c) + 3c*(1/c)^2 + (1/c)^3 = c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, there is no constant term; the exponents are 3, 1, -1, -3. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^1\\) in the product would be 3 * 0 = 0. Let's check by expanding: \\((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\). Multiplying by \\((c + 1/c)^3\\), which is \\(c^3 + 3c + 3/c + 1/c^3\\). So, the term \\(3a^2b\\) multiplied by each term in the second polynomial gives \\(3a^2b c^3 + 9a^2b c + 9a^2b /c + 3a^2b /c^3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 0, which matches our calculation. So, that works.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial instead of the coefficient of the constant term. The correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. Find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This occurs when the exponent \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think again. In the second example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) was 2, which is 1 (from the first part) times 2 (the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part). So, that works. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) (i.e., \\(m = 3\\)), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together yields \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the expansion becomes:\n\\[\na^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\nSo, from this expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Wait, but hold on, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\), it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nHmm, so maybe I don't need to expand the entire product, but just focus on the terms that will result in \\(a^2b^2\\) after multiplication. Since the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms with different powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see how that term interacts with the second expression.\n\nWait a second, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to see if multiplying by the second expression affects that term. But actually, the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, it will just be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some coefficient, and the variables will be \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, maybe the coefficient remains the same?\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The original problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expressions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two together, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we just need to consider the coefficient from the first part. But wait, is that the case? Because in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is being multiplied by all the terms in the second expression, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression times the entire sum of the coefficients in the second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first expression and multiply it by 1 from the second expression, but actually, the second expression is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expression, which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression.\n\nSo, let me confirm that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (which is \\(c^0\\)), you get \\(a^2b^2\\), and all other terms would have some power of \\(c\\), which we're not interested in for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, first, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's figure that out.\n\nAgain, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, maybe I can think of the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and then it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that's not exactly right because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is only when \\(k = 0\\), which we found to be 20. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial and the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, but that's not quite accurate because the second polynomial has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) is only the term where \\(k = 0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms from each polynomial that multiply together to give that term. In this case, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which means I have to consider how the terms from both expansions multiply together.\n\nWait, but actually, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because the \\(a^2b^2\\) term doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, I can consider that any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 (from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times something, but actually, since the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me reread it: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and when you multiply it by any term from the second part, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because each term in the expansion of the second part is a different power of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term becomes a separate term in the product.\n\nBut maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would just be the coefficient from the first part, since the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is 6, and the rest is just multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). But that seems too straightforward, and I might be missing something.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), so that the term is \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nOkay, so let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we multiply the coefficients from each part: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) times 20 (from \\(c^0\\)), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem was just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, then it would just be 6, but since the expression includes both parts, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient when considering the entire product, which includes the constant term in \\(c\\). So, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just go through it again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n3. Find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0: \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n4. Multiply the two coefficients: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Each term has a coefficient, which is the binomial coefficient, and the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) raised to decreasing and increasing powers, respectively. Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that's the third term in the expansion: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\).\n\nLet me compute that binomial coefficient. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(4! / (2! \\cdot (4 - 2)!)\\). Calculating that, \\(4! = 24\\), \\(2! = 2\\), so \\(24 / (2 \\cdot 2) = 24 / 4 = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part of the expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), I think the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but it doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\). So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, perhaps I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems a bit odd because it would be a polynomial in \\(c\\) with multiple terms. Wait, maybe the problem is actually looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have us find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Let me check that interpretation. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power, then I would have to find the product of the coefficients from each expansion such that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think. So, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives me terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which will give me terms in \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2, I think. So, when I multiply these together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, that would mean the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nSo, in the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero is the constant term. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0}\\), which is just \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 6! / (3! \\cdot 3!) = (720)/(6 \\cdot 6) = 720 / 36 = 20\\). So, the constant term in the second expansion is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), giving 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum the coefficients? But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), each with their own coefficients. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but I think that's not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all terms. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because every term in the second expansion would multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial interpretation was correct\u2014that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nBut just to double-check, let me go through the steps again. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). Then, expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term with \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). Therefore, when we multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the problem is expecting me to include all possible terms with \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, not an expression.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), meaning that we treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and just focus on the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which again is a polynomial, not a number. So, that interpretation doesn't make sense either.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'm confident that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). \n\nLet me think. The expression is a product of two binomials raised to powers. So, when I multiply them together, I'll have a product of two sums. To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how the terms from each expansion multiply to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when I multiply the two expansions together, I'll have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nBut the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables. So, when I multiply the two expansions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion. However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, in the problem statement, are we considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, or is there a misunderstanding?\n\nWait, no, the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is separate.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the first part, and it will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when we expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m + n = 6\\). But since \\(c^m \\times (1/c)^n = c^{m - n}\\), the term will have a power of \\(c\\) as \\(m - n\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every possible term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each term in the product will be \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{m - n}\\), so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from \\(k = 2\\), so the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me check again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, in the entire expansion, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we need to collect all terms in the product that have \\(a^2b^2\\), and sum their coefficients.\n\nBut in the product, each term is \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) times a term from the second expansion. So, only when \\(k = 2\\) will we get \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is the same as the constant term in the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nHmm, that makes more sense. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but if \\(c\\) is part of the term, then the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), but the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\). So, I need to clarify.\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. But in algebraic expressions, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically include all possible coefficients regardless of other variables. But in this case, since the expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient, which is a bit confusing because it's a coefficient in a multivariable expression.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nSo, which interpretation is correct? Let me think. In the problem statement, it's written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the entire expression is a product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with various coefficients depending on the terms from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not a single coefficient; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where \\(c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's proceed with that interpretation. Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then multiply them together.\n\nWe already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20.\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 384 if we consider all coefficients, but now I'm getting 120 if we consider only the constant term in \\(c\\). I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), so 120 is the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, treating all variables as separate, then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a single number, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). Therefore, 120 is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, to confirm, let's think about how the product works. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's ambiguous whether they want the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\) or just the coefficient when multiplied by \\(c^0\\). However, in most cases, when a coefficient is asked for a term with multiple variables, it's interpreted as the coefficient of that specific term, considering all variables. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of the first factor and the second factor is in terms of \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each term corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a single number, so it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, which is 20, and multiply them together to get 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. If I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion. So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single coefficient. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times a specific power of \\(c\\), but since it's not specified, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would be the same as multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, let's think about that. The sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all powers of \\(c\\), would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 384, or the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. Given that the problem is written as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in most algebra problems, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of expressions, they usually want the coefficient of that term considering all possible combinations with other variables. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), it's more likely that the coefficient is meant to be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., 120.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me check both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). This would mean that in the product, every term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\) contributes to this coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nSecond interpretation: Coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\). This would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and not specifying any power of \\(c\\), it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which is 120. Because if they wanted the sum over all coefficients, they would probably specify that they want the sum or the total coefficient.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut to make sure, let me consider how the product works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part when \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Then, this is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), where each coefficient corresponds to a different power of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's not a single number but a polynomial. But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and they meant to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). But given the problem as stated, I think the intended answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another way. Suppose I consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), then the value of the expression would be \\((1 + 1)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 16 \\times 64 = 1024\\). But that's the sum of all coefficients. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nBut if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, as calculated. However, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), the value would include all terms, so it's not directly giving the coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 1\\), \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients, which is 1024. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384, which is part of that sum. So, 384 is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) considering all powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, if the problem is asking for that, the answer is 384.\n\nBut I'm still confused because the problem is ambiguous. Let me see if I can find similar problems or think of how it's usually phrased. Typically, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of two expressions, especially when the variables are different, it's often interpreted as the coefficient of that term in the first expression multiplied by the entire second expression. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, it's more likely that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in a context where \\(c\\) is being treated as a separate variable, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is to be found in the product, considering \\(c\\) as another variable. But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let's think about the problem again. The problem is written as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, in the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by various terms from the second expansion, each involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which is a single number, so that suggests that they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let me think about the structure of the product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and it's multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, so 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nSo, after all this thinking, I believe the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

The coefficients here will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion would be \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nWait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so looking at the expansion, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I think I need to consider the entire product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term.\n\nWait, no, that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, that means we're only interested in the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero because \\(c^0 = 1\\), so that term would contribute to the constant term, and thus, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Let me first find the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, each term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the term that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, which is just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\).\n\nSo, the term when \\(m = 3\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a coefficient of 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, the first part gives \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives \\(20c^0\\), so when you multiply them, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two expansions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since these are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap to make sure. I first expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since these two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 20, which is 120. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI was a bit confused at first about whether I needed to consider all the terms in the second expansion, but then I realized that since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), any term involving \\(c\\) wouldn't affect that coefficient because \\(a^2b^2\\) is separate from \\(c\\). So, only the constant term in the second expansion would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nAnother way to approach it might be to consider the entire expansion, but that would be more complicated. I think the method I used is the most straightforward. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)**:\n   Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The term when \\(m = 3\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combining the results**:\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a sum involving terms with \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, but that's not possible because each term in the expansion will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion. But then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\), but it's not specified. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{2}b^{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Wait, but that might not be the right way to think about it. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, that can't be right because then the coefficient would include terms with \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, actually, each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and \\(c\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) would be 6 times \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). So, perhaps it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nIf that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because when I set \\(c = 1\\), I'm effectively summing all the coefficients in the second part, which gives me the total contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that's 6 multiplied by 64, which is indeed 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)^2\\) gives \\(a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and expanding \\((c + 1/c)\\) gives \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying these together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), which would give 1*(c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2*(c + 1/c), and so on. So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the entire product, it would be 1*(1 + 1) = 2, since setting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients as 2. \n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, setting \\(c = 1\\) in the second part gives the sum of all its coefficients as 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6*64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: since the two parts are multiplied together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\) would be 6 times the coefficients from the second expansion. But since we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we sum all those contributions, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 6*64=384.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving different powers of \\(c\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we multiply the coefficient from the first part (6) by the sum of coefficients from the second part (64), giving 6*64=384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning. So, the coefficient should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), each multiplied by a binomial coefficient. The general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. Now, I'm specifically looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the coefficient for this term in the expansion.\n\nLet me figure out what \\(k\\) would be for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the exponent of \\(a\\) is \\(4 - k\\), setting that equal to 2 gives \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6, and the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\).\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I realize that the part involving \\(c\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. In other words, when multiplying out the entire expression, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since I'm only asked about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two expansions. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), that means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the product will be a combination of a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that means the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means that in the product, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and each of those products will have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some power of \\(c\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that implies that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe I should consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the product will be of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because each term in the product will be \\(6a^2b^2\\) times a term from the second expansion, and when you collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the entire product's expansion will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). That would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe another approach is to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial, but in this case, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would require considering all possible combinations where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But since the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, considering all possible terms, so that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, giving 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems too broad.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables, so substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\). The sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1)^1\\) is \\(2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let's check by expanding: \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1) = a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is \\(c + 1\\). Wait, but if we're considering the coefficient regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) plus the coefficient from \\(a^2c\\), which is 1, so total 2. So, yes, that works. Therefore, in that example, the coefficient is indeed the product of the individual coefficients times the sum of the coefficients in the other expansion.\n\nSo, applying that to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, I would need to find the term where in \\((a + b)^4\\), we have \\(a^2b^2\\), and in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we have \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that's a different interpretation. So, the problem could be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in that case, I need to compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6.\n\nSo, let's compute the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20, and then multiplying by 6 from the first part, we get 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, so now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought the answer was 384, but now I'm getting 120. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me clarify the problem statement again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). So, the coefficient would be the sum over all \\(k\\) of the coefficients from each part multiplied together.\n\nWait, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem as stated is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). So, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a specific term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, which suggests that perhaps it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out to zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, where I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) was \\(c + 1\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem here is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a function of \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense as a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with the problem statement again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut now I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120, but now I'm thinking it's 384. Let me try to think of it another way.\n\nSuppose I set \\(c = 1\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the entire product becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this product would be 64 times the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 64 * 6 = 384. So, that seems to confirm that the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I set \\(c = 1\\), I get the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times 64, which is 384. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, when I set \\(c = 1\\), I got the sum of the coefficients, and that gave me the correct coefficient when considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. So, in this problem, setting \\(c = 1\\) gives me the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and then multiplying by 6 gives me 384, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, considering the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

The binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!(4 - 2)!} = \\dfrac{24}{2 \\times 2} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think.\n\nSince the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That means when I multiply them together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression should just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but wait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the coefficients add up.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. Actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is in the first part, and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term's coefficient contributes to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But wait, no, that's not quite right either because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first polynomial, and when multiplied by the entire second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial will have a coefficient that gets multiplied by 6 (the coefficient from \\(a^2b^2\\)). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the terms involving \\(c\\) would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself would remain 6, right?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is not multiplied by any \\(c\\) terms, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will have their own variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the product would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times each coefficient from the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), perhaps we're considering all possible terms, but actually, no. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first polynomial, and when you multiply it by the second polynomial, each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term's coefficient is multiplied by 6. So, as I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by plugging \\(c = 1\\), which gives 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem specifically says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but the problem doesn't specify that. It just asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think the correct approach is to compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try expanding both parts separately and see.\n\nFirst, expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As I did before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\nNow, expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), as I thought earlier.\n\nTherefore, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by considering specific terms. For example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6a^2b^2. When multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), it becomes 6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Suppose I consider the entire product and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first factor and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the second, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first factor, and the second factor contributes all its terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the coefficient from the first factor times the sum of all coefficients from the second factor.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to collect like terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for each part separately.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion becomes \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nOkay, so I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6 in this part. But wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider that when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), because the entire product will involve terms from both expansions.\n\nWait, hold on. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, the result will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times some term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) will remain as they are, and the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) is formed. That is, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term from the second part. However, when we talk about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, we're only considering the part that's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, no, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\); it only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself in the entire product would actually be zero unless the second part contributes a constant term, i.e., a term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is 1, then multiplying it by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's the only way the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be non-zero. Otherwise, if the second part only has terms with positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), then multiplying them by \\(a^2b^2\\) would give terms with \\(c\\) exponents, and thus \\(a^2b^2\\) wouldn't appear as a standalone term without \\(c\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right either. Let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That is, in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we're looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which might imply that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) times whatever comes from the second part. But wait, no, because in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get multiple terms, each with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would only be present if the second part has a term with \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, all terms would have \\(c\\) exponents, and \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), not as a standalone term.\n\nWait, so perhaps I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because that's the only term that would result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part. So, if I can find the constant term in the second expansion, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by that constant term.\n\nOkay, let's try that approach. First, let's find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) has a coefficient of 6, and when we multiply this by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me double-check each step.\n\nFirst, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\): Yes, using the binomial coefficients, the expansion is correct, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNext, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\): Using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, to find the constant term, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is correct.\n\nThen, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms is if it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but is that the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\)? Let me think. Suppose I don't consider the constant term, but instead, I think of the entire product as a product of two polynomials. So, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which is of the form \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be present with coefficients equal to each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion isn't a constant; it's a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but none of these would be just \\(a^2b^2\\) unless \\(k = 0\\), which is the constant term. Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when \\(k = 0\\), so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's possible that the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is actually the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is separate, so when you multiply, each term would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term with \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: When the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), or does it mean the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\)? If it's the former, meaning just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient is 120, as I found earlier. If it's the latter, meaning any term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for any \\(k\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because each term in the second expansion is separate.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, 1, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\), each with their respective coefficients. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the product as \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\), each with coefficients corresponding to the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any \\(c\\) terms) is 6 * 20 = 120, as I thought earlier. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it's a different story. But I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning without any \\(c\\) exponents. So, in that case, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when it's multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a specific term in one part is multiplied by all terms in the other part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second expression. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numbers, not expressions. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but that's not possible because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a separate variable from \\(c\\). Therefore, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is when it's multiplied by a term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a polynomial in variables \\(a, b, c\\). Then, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have coefficients that include all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, that can't be correct. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) term, which would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\). But that would be the same as 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as I thought earlier. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that's not a number. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning with \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in standard polynomial terminology, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term, say \\(a^2b^2\\), in a product of polynomials, it's usually referring to the coefficient of that term multiplied by any possible combination of the other variables. But in this case, the other variables are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\), which would mean summing over all \\(k\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me think again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4, a^3b, a^2b^2, ab^3, b^4\\). Each of these is then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6, a^2b^2c^4, a^2b^2c^2, a^2b^2, a^2b^2c^{-2}, a^2b^2c^{-4}, a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any \\(c\\) exponent) is 6 * 20 = 120, as I found earlier. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which isn't a number. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning without any \\(c\\) exponents, which would be 120.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 (c + 1/c)^1\\). Let's compute this: \\((a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) as a standalone term without \\(c\\), then it's zero because there's no term without \\(c\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is zero. Similarly, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is 120, but if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is not a number. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) in \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient as a polynomial, but that seems unlikely. More likely, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which would require the \\(c\\) exponents to cancel out, i.e., the constant term. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when I multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving me \\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 6a^2b^2c^4 + 6a^2b^2c^2 + 6a^2b^2 + 6a^2b^2c^{-2} + 6a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) exponents) is 6, but that's not correct because the constant term is 20, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, no, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (i.e., \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which is a polynomial, but that doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, meaning multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial. So, in that case, the coefficient is not a number but a polynomial. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial, which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem asks for a coefficient, which is typically a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from both expansions. But that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too high, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) would have terms where each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But since the problem asks for a coefficient, which is a number, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but since it's not specified, I'll assume it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) step by step. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\), with coefficients as we found. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when you multiply these, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., each with coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6 * 1 = 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\) is 6 * 15 = 90, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\) is 6 * 6 = 36, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\) is 6 * 1 = 6.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) specifically (without any \\(c\\) exponents) is 120. So, that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about this differently. Suppose I consider the entire product as a product of two polynomials, and I want to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, that can't be right. So, the only way to get a numerical coefficient is if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum is 64, and 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) exponents, would be 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, but in standard polynomial terminology, when you ask for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, you usually mean that term with specific exponents for all variables. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's likely referring to the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think I've spent enough time thinking through this. The answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then identifying the relevant term.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion is:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the expansion includes a constant term when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This occurs at \\(k = 3\\), giving:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   Multiply the coefficient from the first expansion by the constant term from the second expansion:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, that's straightforward. Now, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of these two expansions.\n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so maybe the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that the entire term from the first part will just be multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would create terms with \\(c\\) in them, which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero.\n\nLet me check that. So, expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero because that's the constant term. So, setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion, which has a coefficient of 6, will be multiplied by 20 from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for the constant term. When I multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term from the second part, giving me 6 * 20 = 120. Are there any other terms that could contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Well, in the first part, \\(a^2b^2\\) is unique, so no other terms from the first expansion will contribute. And in the second part, only the constant term will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) without introducing any \\(c\\) terms. So, yes, 120 should be the correct coefficient.\n\nI think that's it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, which gives a coefficient of 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together yields 120.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem.\n\nSo, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) would give me terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and so on, up to \\(\\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). Since I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Let me compute that binomial coefficient: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well because the entire expression is the product of these two expansions. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, does that mean that when I multiply the two expansions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part? Or is there more to it?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. When I multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). So, when I multiply it by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to consider how that affects the term. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), multiplying it by any term from the second expansion would just add a factor involving \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) (which is \\(c^{-1}\\)) can be anything because the problem doesn't specify any constraint on \\(c\\).\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, that means I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, because every term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in that expansion would be when \\(c = 1\\), right? Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) gives the sum of coefficients. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, each term in the second part will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second expansion's coefficient. But that seems similar to what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire product as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply a term by the entire second expansion, each term in the second expansion contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, yes, that would make the coefficient 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can treat \\(c\\) and \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\) as separate variables, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because any term in the second part multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will just add a factor involving \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it's equivalent to multiplying the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire expression as a product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part contributes to the overall coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is indeed \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this with a specific example. Suppose I expand both parts:\n\nFirst part: \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, it's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, the second part is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when I multiply the first part by the second part, each term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is 6a^2b^2. When I multiply this by each term in the second part, I get 6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2c^{-2} + 36a^2b^2c^{-4} + 6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, all these terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the sum of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Each of these terms has a coefficient from the second part multiplied by 6.\n\nSo, the coefficients from the second part are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1. So, adding these up: 1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 15 = 22, 22 + 20 = 42, 42 + 15 = 57, 57 + 6 = 63, 63 + 1 = 64. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64, as I thought earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in my earlier step-by-step multiplication, each term's coefficient was 6 times the coefficient from the second part. So, adding all those up would be 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when considered as a polynomial in \\(c\\), has a sum of coefficients equal to 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6*64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. Let me compute \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) separately and then see the product.\n\nWe know that \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nAnd \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\).\n\nWhen we multiply these two, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all coefficients from these terms, which is 6*(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1) = 6*64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the entire product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of coefficients in the second part is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64 = 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately and then combining the results. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\):**  \n   Using the binomial theorem, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**  \n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**  \n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

Now, the original expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, okay, so I need to consider both parts. But wait, the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I don't need to expand the entire expression, but only focus on the term that gives \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by something from the second part.\n\nLet me think: When I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second. But since the problem is only concerned with the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can focus on the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and see how it interacts with the second expansion.\n\nWait, but actually, no. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. But in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by various terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But wait, the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Or is it?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire product, which includes terms with \\(c\\). But does that mean that the coefficient can include terms with \\(c\\)? Or is it asking for the coefficient when considering only the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms?\n\nWait, actually, I think I need to clarify. In the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial. But maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because usually, when someone asks for the coefficient of a specific term in a product, they might be considering the entire expression, but perhaps they're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the other variables. Alternatively, maybe they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by a specific term from the other part.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the expression is a product of two binomials, each raised to a power. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 6. Now, when we multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another binomial expansion, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so in the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have a coefficient that is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient is supposed to be a numerical factor, not an expression involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression, meaning that we can treat \\(c\\) as another variable, but perhaps we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make much sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's just written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because coefficients are usually constants, not expressions with variables.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually written incorrectly, or I'm misinterpreting it. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" Hmm, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, resulting in \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, perhaps they want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That makes more sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems less likely because usually, when you ask for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're considering the term with specific exponents in all variables. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so perhaps the coefficient is the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that seems too broad.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) expands to terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nOkay, so let me proceed with that interpretation. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for the term \\(a^2b^2c^0\\).\n\nSo, let's work on expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The binomial expansion is:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\):\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) will have \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me calculate it properly:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\dfrac{120}{6} = 20\n\\]\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), we multiply these two coefficients together:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Is the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\) the only term we're considering? Or are there other terms that might contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term involving \\(c\\), it will just be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\). But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a constant, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be 120, as I calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that seems unlikely because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But that seems odd because usually, coefficients are constants, not polynomials.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering that the product is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that's not a standard interpretation. Typically, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, they're referring to the coefficient of that specific term across all variables, but in this case, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), leaving \\(c\\) unspecified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), as I thought earlier. So, perhaps the answer is 120.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because coefficients are constants. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make the answer 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion, but that seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in one polynomial is independent of the other. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20, so when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think the answer is 120.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with another approach. Let's consider the entire product as:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{i}b^{4 - i} \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j} \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when we multiply these two sums, each term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{i}\\dbinom{6}{j} a^{i}b^{4 - i}c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nWe are looking for the coefficient where \\(i = 2\\) and \\(4 - i = 2\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). Additionally, we want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), which gives \\(j = 3\\).\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that:\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\)\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (considering \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\). Hmm. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because coefficients are constants, not polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), which would be \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the answer is 120.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable interpretation. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me consider another perspective. Suppose I expand the entire product. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a coefficient of 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will be multiplied by 6, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd. However, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a Laurent polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unlikely. Therefore, I think the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nYes, I'm confident now that the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Okay, so the terms are \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so I think I need to consider that as well. \n\nWait, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to expand the entire second part. Let me think. Since the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Now, when this term is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve c or 1/c. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, is that right? Let me make sure. So, if I have 6a\u00b2b\u00b2 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then the a\u00b2b\u00b2 term will be present in each term of the expansion, but the coefficient of a\u00b2b\u00b2 in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but only for the terms where the power of c is zero because a\u00b2b\u00b2 doesn't involve c. So, yes, I think that's correct. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nLet me recall the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\((c + 1/c)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\).\n\nSo, I need the exponent of c to be zero, which means 6 - 2k = 0. Solving for k, 6 = 2k, so k = 3. Therefore, the term where k=3 will have c^0. So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\).\n\nCalculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, correct. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of c is zero, which happens when k=3, and that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) which is 20. So, when you multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term is 6 * 20 = 120.

Now, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm a bit confused here because I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but this part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Wait, so does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms are separate from the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Let me think. Since the expression is a product of two separate expansions, maybe each part is independent. So, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts are in one binomial, and the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) parts are in another. So, when I multiply them together, the coefficients for the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That makes sense because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, so their exponents don't interfere with each other.\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can compute the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't sound quite right. Because if I do that, I would be multiplying the coefficient 6 by the entire expansion, which would give me a lot of terms, but I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and since the other part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), is being multiplied by it, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 multiplied by whatever the constant term is in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), because any other term would involve \\(c\\) raised to some power, which we don't care about for \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The entire expression is the product of two expansions. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that doesn't sound right either because that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is not correct because the question is about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That makes more sense because then the \\(c\\) terms would affect the coefficient we're looking for.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, how do I find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)?\n\nUsing the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\).\n\nTherefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20.\n\nNow, since the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is the same as \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which equals 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6, and the term \\(c^0\\) comes from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two terms together, you get \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier when considering whether the \\(c\\) terms affect the coefficient. Let me confirm: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. So, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), you would need to consider all possible ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which would be \\(6 \\times (1 + 1)^6 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But that can't be right because that would imply that every term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), which is not the case.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then that would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second part.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all possible \\(c\\) exponents. But that's not how coefficients work. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, each multiplied by their respective \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(2^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem might actually be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning only the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part, and then multiply them together. That would be 6 times 20, which is 120, as I found earlier. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for.\n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying anything about \\(c\\). So, that could mean that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all \\(c\\) terms would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial.\n\nBut the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times 20, which is 120. But since the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), I'm not sure which interpretation is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems a bit odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product, you're looking for the coefficient of that term in the entire product, considering all variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2\\), that would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is indeed 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{6 - 2m} \\times 1/c^m\\), but wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has a power of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\), where \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6.\n\nNow, when you multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has terms \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\), the entire expression becomes a product of these two expansions. So, each term in the product will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^kb^{4 - k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nSo, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means I need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is just \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, in the second part, the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything, but since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, I need to sum over all possible \\(m\\) values. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nThe sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, setting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it might be 120 if we were looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct answer is 384. But I'm a bit confused because the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so it's ambiguous. Let me check online to see if there's a standard interpretation.\n\nWait, no, I can't check online, but I can think about it. In algebra, when you're asked for the coefficient of a term in a product of polynomials, you're typically looking for the coefficient of that term regardless of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would include all possible exponents of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me try a smaller example to see if that makes sense. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, we get \\(a \\times c + a \\times (1/c) + b \\times c + b \\times (1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), right? Because \\(a\\) is multiplied by both \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it would be \\(c + 1/c\\). But if I were to ask for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it would be the sum of the coefficients, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is not a constant. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a numerical value, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're only interested in the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nBut the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm not sure. Let me think again. If I expand the entire expression, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, so each term will be \\(a^2b^2\\) times a term involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are typically numerical values. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a numerical value.\n\nSo, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable, and I think that's the intended interpretation.\n\nWait, but to confirm, let's consider the definition of a coefficient. In the context of polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the constant that multiplies the variables. So, if the term is \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), the coefficient would be the numerical factor in front of it. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), it's ambiguous. However, in many problems, when only one set of variables is mentioned, the others are considered to be at their lowest power, often \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only concerned with the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts and ignores the \\(c\\) parts, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression includes \\(c\\). So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but in the smaller example I did earlier, if I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's a polynomial in \\(c\\), which would be 6 times \\((c + 1/c)^6\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is typically a number, not a polynomial.\n\nTherefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term, so the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem is stated as: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 120, considering that the \\(c\\) terms are being ignored, or that the coefficient is being taken as a constant term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me do a quick calculation. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.\n\n3. **Combine the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
