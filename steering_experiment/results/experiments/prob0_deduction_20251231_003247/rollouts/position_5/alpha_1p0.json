    "text": " If I expand this, the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm not directly asked about the terms involving \\(c\\), so maybe I don't need to expand this part fully. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product. So, actually, I need to consider how this part contributes. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't have to worry about the \\(c\\) terms as long as I'm only considering the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Hmm, that might not be right. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first expansion, the second expansion will contribute a factor, but perhaps the \\(c\\) terms will just tag along, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I can treat the second part as a single term, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, because when you expand the second part, each term is a power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), perhaps I just need to find the coefficient from the first part and then multiply it by the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which isn't possible because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, but the problem didn't specify that. Hmm, maybe I should read the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product, and when you expand it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by some terms involving \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which doesn't make sense because that's a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a number. So, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, but since \\(c\\) is present, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but that seems unlikely because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense either. Hmm, maybe I should look at it differently. Let me think: when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the constant term in \\(c\\) when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, let me assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the constant term in \\(c\\). \n\nSo, to find this, I need to first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already determined is 6. Then, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once I have that, I can multiply them together to get the final coefficient. \n\nSo, let's focus on \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, this expands to \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, multiplying these together, we get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\)) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. The problem didn't specify the \\(c\\) term, so maybe I was wrong to assume it's \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, I think my initial assumption that it's asking for the constant term in \\(c\\) is correct. \n\nLet me summarize:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6.\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n3. Multiply these coefficients together: 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be 6 times a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so I think the correct interpretation is that we're looking for the constant term in \\(c\\), making the coefficient 120. \n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nChecking the binomial coefficients:\n\n- \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\) \u2714\ufe0f\n- Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here. I need to consider the entire product.\n\nSo, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect it, right? Or do they? Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials. So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial.\n\nBut since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to consider how \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product. Let me think: when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the variables are independent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term (if any) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), you won't get just \\(a^2b^2\\); you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times 1/c^k\\), which are different terms.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, no, actually, no. Wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if you have \\( (a^2b^2) \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6) \\), then each term in the product will be \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself will only be present if the second polynomial has a term with \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, in the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, let me find that.\n\nFirst, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies 2k = 6 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the entire first polynomial by the second polynomial, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by 20, resulting in a term \\(20a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 20 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. So, 20 * 6 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) includes a constant term, which is 20. So, when you multiply the two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first is multiplied by all terms in the second, but only the constant term in the second will result in a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have additional factors of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make them different terms. So, the only contribution to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product comes from multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I consider the entire product. The entire product is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\text{terms involving } a \\text{ and } b \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{terms involving } c \\text{ and } 1/c \\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when you multiply these, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it comes from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion. But only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) raised to some power, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only term contributing to \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term 20 from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to think of the entire expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum over all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by terms from the second polynomial that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But since the second polynomial only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the multiplication doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients from the second polynomial. Wait, no, that's not correct because the second polynomial's terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) variables, so when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, only the constant term in the second polynomial will result in a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have \\(c\\) factors, which would make them different terms.\n\nWait, but if I consider the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but no, that's not correct because the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the sum of its coefficients would be when you set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384, which contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, that's confusing. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which includes all variables. Wait, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the variables are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by \\(c^0\\) to remain as \\(a^2b^2\\). If it's multiplied by \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different terms. Therefore, the only contribution to the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial by the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be the same as 120. But the problem just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a bit ambiguous. Wait, actually, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you have multiple variables, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would imply that the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, because otherwise, the term would include \\(c\\) as well. So, I think it's safe to assume that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nBut to double-check, let's consider a simpler case. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding this, we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\n\\]\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\n\\]\nMultiplying them together:\n\\[\n(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c) = a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\n\\]\nSo, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't exist because the highest power of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is 2 each, but in the product, each term has either \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, there's no term like \\(a^2b^2\\) without \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero in this case. Wait, but in our original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) does exist because the first polynomial has that term, and the second polynomial has a constant term. So, in our original problem, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists and its coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but in the simpler case I just considered, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\), there is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term. Wait, no, in that case, the second polynomial does have a constant term? Wait, no, \\((c + 1/c)^1\\) doesn't have a constant term because when you expand it, it's \\(c + 1/c\\), which are both degree 1 and -1 in \\(c\\). So, there's no \\(c^0\\) term. Therefore, in that product, there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is by multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant term in the second polynomial. Since the second polynomial doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient is zero.\n\nIn our original problem, the second polynomial does have a constant term, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I think my initial conclusion is correct: the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider another example. Suppose we have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). Expanding the second polynomial:\n\n\\[\n(c + 1/c)^2 = c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2\n\\]\nSo, the constant term is 2. Then, multiplying by \\((a + b)\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2) = a c^2 + 2a + a/c^2 + b c^2 + 2b + b/c^2\n\\]\nSo, in this case, the term \\(2a\\) comes from multiplying \\(a\\) by the constant term 2. Similarly, the term \\(2b\\) comes from multiplying \\(b\\) by 2. So, if we were to look for the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product, it would be 2, and the coefficient of \\(b\\) would also be 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are each 2, which is the product of the coefficient in the first polynomial (which is 1 for both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) times the constant term in the second polynomial (which is 2). So, this supports the idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when you take the product of the polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20, so when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

Using the binomial theorem, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). I know that \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I also need to consider the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think I need to expand this part as well, but since I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Hmm, is that right?\n\nLet me think. When I multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, and then I multiply it by any term from the second part, it will become \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(something with } c\\text{)}\\). But the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which means we're only interested in the term where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2, regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, I think I need to be careful here. Because when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't change unless you're combining terms, but in this case, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), it's separate. So, actually, the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are independent of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient shouldn't depend on \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I have \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it will be multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is irrespective of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because regardless of what's happening with \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times whatever the entire second part is, but that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a, b, c, 1/c\\), and they're asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) terms. But the way the question is phrased, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean that the \\(c\\) part can be anything, so the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't seem right because the question is probably expecting a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expression and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of what's on \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part, because each term in the second part would be multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The sum of all the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. Is that correct?\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so perhaps the coefficient is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can first find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a product, and they're asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In other words, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product being equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. So, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression as a single expression and asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients from the second part multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Since the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64, then 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way. Let's consider expanding the entire expression:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{i} a^{4 - i}b^i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^j \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second part:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - j} c^{-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nSo, the entire product is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{4}{i} \\dbinom{6}{j} a^{4 - i}b^i c^{6 - 2j}\n\\]\n\nNow, we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, we set \\(4 - i = 2\\) and \\(i = 2\\). So, \\(i = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{j=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{j} c^{6 - 2j}\\).\n\nBut wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it's 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial has only \\(c\\) terms, which are separate from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire expression and asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), and we just want the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of the \\(c\\) part. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a constant factor, but that doesn't make sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That is, we want the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). In that case, we would need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), then we need to consider the term where \\(j = 3\\), which gives \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nBut wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm supposed to consider all possible terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial, but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering only the \\(c^0\\) term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that seems odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 120, considering only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term.\n\nWait, let me confirm. If we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is a polynomial. But since the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, perhaps it's intended that we consider the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), which is when \\(6 - 2j = 0\\), so \\(j = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

    "text": " I need to find the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about how that works. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the general term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, I want the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has another part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm supposed to multiply this with \\((a + b)^4\\), so the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, right? Because the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two parts together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nBut since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that term separately. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the other part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), will contribute a term that's multiplied by 1 in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms with various powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think we can just take the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then consider the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me think again. The expression is a product of two polynomials: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). When I multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying a term in \\((a + b)^4\\) that has \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that has \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nOkay, so I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me apply the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, because that's \\(c^0\\). So, I set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), I get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6 * 6 = 36. So, 720 divided by 36 is 20. Yes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Because when I multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) in the second polynomial. So, yes, that should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply the two expressions, each term in the first will be multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will come from multiplying the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial by the term with \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, because any other term in the second polynomial would have a power of \\(c\\), which would make the entire term have a \\(c\\) component, which we don't want because we're looking for a term without \\(c\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from that specific product.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again. \n\n1. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is found when \\(k=2\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). That seems correct.\n\n2. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k=3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). That also seems correct.\n\n3. Multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's right. So, the final answer should be 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, the general term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which occurs when \\(k = 2\\).

So, let me think, if I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from when the exponent of \\(a\\) is 2 and the exponent of \\(b\\) is 2. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient for this term would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), right? Because the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), so when \\(k = 2\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out how this interacts with the first part. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\). That means, in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(c\\) terms might not affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about that. When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the terms in the second expression that don't involve \\(c\\) either. Wait, but \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to terms involving various powers of \\(c\\), right? So, unless there's a term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, meaning \\(c^0\\), that term would be a constant. So, maybe I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

If I don't multiply by a constant term, then the term would have some power of \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, I think I should first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then multiply it by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, to get the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me try that. So, to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\) so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20. Since these are multiplied together, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when \\(k = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " Let me expand that part first. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the sum from k=0 to 4 of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\).

But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression, not just \\((a + b)^4\\). That means I need to multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, when I multiply these two expressions, the terms from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by the terms from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider how this term is affected by the multiplication. Let me think: when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear in the final product is if it's multiplied by some term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will actually be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the ways that \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by multiplying terms from both expansions. But actually, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the only way it can come about is if it's multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., a constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because if I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), it would result in a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) and 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). So, multiplying them together: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). Thus, the result is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Cool, so that part is done. Now, the original expression is this expansion multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression as the product of these two expansions. But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to consider all the terms from the first expansion, just the one that has \\(a^2b^2\\). From the expansion above, that's the term \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 multiplied by whatever the coefficient is of the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a constant, you just get the same coefficient. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it only involves \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), I need to find the part of the second expansion that is a constant term (i.e., the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero). That way, when I multiply it by \\(6a^2b^2\\), I'll get \\(6 \\times \\text{constant term} \\times a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient I'm looking for is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, now I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to do that. Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(6 = 2m\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = \\dbinom{6}{3} \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term of 20. So when you multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by 20, so the coefficient becomes \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). That seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying those together gives 120.

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by each term in the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would imply that we're looking for the term where the second part contributes a coefficient without any \\(c\\) terms. But \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't have a constant term (i.e., a term with \\(c^0\\)), right? Let me check that. \n\nWait, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. Let's see if any of these exponents are zero, which would give a constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). So, when \\(k = 3\\), the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20 \\times 1 = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. That means, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nTherefore, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. However, since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), we need to consider all the terms in the second expansion and sum their coefficients. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second part is a multiple of \\(c\\) raised to some power, but when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it becomes \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient times \\(c\\) to some power. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then we have to consider all the terms in the second part, because each one contributes to a different term in the product. However, the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that we're considering the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. Because if we include all the terms with different powers of \\(c\\), then \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those, but the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think refers to the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4 and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for each \\(m\\) from 0 to 6, we have a term \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\) with coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these terms, we get terms like \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which I think is referring to the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the second part has a constant term of 20, so when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But the sum of the coefficients in the second part is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384. But that doesn't make sense because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be multiplied by all the terms in the second expansion, leading to multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 times 64 is 384. But I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. \n\nWait, let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, in the entire product, we have terms involving \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different \\(k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut earlier, I thought that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. So, which one is correct? Let me think about it differently. If the problem had been \\((a + b)^4 \\times (1 + 1)^6\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded has terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes to a different term in the product, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all those contributions. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because if we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only multiplied by the constant term of the second expansion to give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you have \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\), that's a different term from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's referring to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). In that case, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to a term of the form \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut I'm still not entirely sure. Let me try to think of a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). So, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because there are no terms with both \\(a^2\\) and \\(b^2\\). Wait, that's not helpful. Let me try another example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = ac + a/c + bc + b/c. Here, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), and similarly for \\(b\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\), it's \\(c + 1/c\\). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(b\\) is the same. But in this case, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's \\(1 \\times (c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient is the same as the second expansion. But in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because coefficients are numerical, not expressions. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would be the product of the coefficients from each part, considering that the variables are separate. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. Because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you think about it, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Any other term from the second expansion would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which would make it \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we find the term that is a constant (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)). This occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, which happens when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nWhen we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, so that would be \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think about how that term would look. Using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if I set \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will become \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) might be multiplied by some term in the other expansion that doesn't change the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, the second part involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) remain the same. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because the question is only about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, but perhaps the entire expression's coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in one is multiplied by each term in the other. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term from the first part, and when multiplied by the entire second part, which is in terms of \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) varies. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, because each term in the second part is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, that can't be right because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the entire second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right either because each term in the product would have different powers of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) would just be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so let me check that. The second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I set \\(c = 1\\), then it becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the result is \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which we already found to be 6. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Once we have those two coefficients, multiply them together to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense because the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the constant term in \\(c\\), resulting in a single numerical coefficient.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step. First, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, let's find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To do this, we can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming we're considering the term where \\(c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the problem correctly. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) is some exponent. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), that would mean summing over all possible \\(m\\), which would give 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. But the problem doesn't specify the power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems a bit odd because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify any power for \\(c\\), so perhaps it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That would mean that each term in the product where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears would contribute to the coefficient, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, when multiplied by the entire second part, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion. That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number, 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, which would make the coefficient 120. Let me think about this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make much sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, let me check another approach. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), \\(a^3b^1\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^1b^3\\), and \\(a^0b^4\\). Each of these terms is then multiplied by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) where \\(k + l = 4\\) and \\(m\\) varies. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for any \\(m\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial. But the problem is likely expecting a single number, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I can consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) and is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, to clarify, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then the answer would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 * 20 = 120. Since the problem didn't specify the power of \\(c\\), but just asked for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's expecting the first interpretation, 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, meaning that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, but the problem doesn't care about the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial. But that can't be, because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\nSo, to summarize: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.

    "text": " Let me expand that. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}ab^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}b^4\\). Calculating the coefficients, \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} = 1\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} = 4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} = 4\\), and \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} = 1\\). So, the expansion is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \n\nNow, I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this expansion is 6. But wait, the original problem is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I can't just stop here because the entire expression is multiplied by another binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, so I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nLet me think. When you multiply two polynomials together, the coefficients of the terms combine. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are different variables, the only way a term will contain \\(a^2b^2\\) is if the term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). In other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply, the variables don't interfere with each other. \n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. If I have a term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the resulting term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) something with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think I need to consider all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. But wait, actually, no. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's considering all terms in the product where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\) are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, and when you multiply it by the entire second expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient gets multiplied by each term in the second expansion, effectively scaling it by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in multiple ways. Specifically, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), \\(c^2\\), \\(c^0\\), \\(c^{-2}\\), \\(c^{-4}\\), \\(c^{-6}\\), each with their own coefficients. \n\nBut when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's considering all possible products where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when multiplied by 6, it contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to find this, I need to compute the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let's consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, this is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) for each term \\(c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of these coefficients is indeed \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\), since the sum of binomial coefficients is \\(2^n\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is it correct to just multiply the coefficients? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the entire second part is a polynomial where each term has a coefficient, and when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, if I didn't think about it that way, I could consider that each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each of which has a coefficient. So, the total contribution to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check with a smaller example to make sure. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1 = c + 1/c\\). The product would be \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) (which is \\(a^2\\)) is 1 from the first term and 1 from the third term, but wait, no. Actually, in this case, \\(a^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times 2 = 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 times 2 = 2. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you expand \\((a + b)^2(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is indeed 1 * c + 1 * (1/c), so the coefficient is (c + 1/c), but if you're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) regardless of c, then it's the sum of coefficients, which is 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 2, which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, for \\(ab\\), it's 2 * 2 = 4, and for \\(b^2\\), it's 1 * 2 = 2. So, that seems to work. \n\nTherefore, applying that logic back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

    "text": " Let me think about how this will expand. Using the binomial theorem, each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the expansion will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this expansion is 6. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), so when we multiply, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will multiply with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms at all? Or do we? Wait, no, because the entire expression is the product of two expansions, so when we multiply, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by any term from the second part. However, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but the problem is asking only for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would imply that we're looking for the coefficient when the term is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, in other words, we need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense because when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will multiply each term in the second expansion, but only the term with \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think that's the key here.\n\nSo, let me write this down step by step. First, expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. As I did earlier, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in this expansion because when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), I want the term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, let's expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well.\n\nUsing the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). Now, I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0 = 1\\), which is the term we need to multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nSo, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\\\\n2k = 6 \\\\\nk = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, and the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the entire expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when we multiply these two expansions, each term from the first expansion will multiply each term from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first expansion, and we want it multiplied by the term from the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), which we found to have a coefficient of 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from the two expansions. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first expansion gives me a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and the second expansion gives me a term \\(20c^0\\). When I multiply these, I get \\(6 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't affect the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the binomial coefficients correctly. For the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And for the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is a polynomial in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\). When I multiply them, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write out the entire product, it would be:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\left(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\right) \\times \\left(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSo, when I multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will multiply each term in the second polynomial, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, among all these terms, the only one that is \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is \\(120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that multiplication. So, \\(6a^2b^2\\) times 20 (the constant term) is indeed 120a^2b^2. So, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the coefficient is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\).

Now, the entire expression is this multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \\(a\\) is 2 and the power of \\(b\\) is 2. Looking at the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I calculated earlier. So, the term is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, this term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), I can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nActually, when we multiply two polynomials together, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and not \\(c\\), it means that we're looking for the part of the product where the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by a term that has \\(c^0\\), because any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) would introduce a power of \\(c\\) into the term. So, essentially, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by that, it will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nSo, let me focus on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\n\nSo, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). I need to find the value of \\(k\\) such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, set the exponent equal to 0:\n\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(k\\):\n\n\\[\n6 = 2k \\implies k = 3\n\\]\n\nSo, the term where \\(k = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient for this term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\n\\]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute that again. 6! is 720, 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. So, 720 divided by 36 is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20.\n\nTherefore, the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, going back to the original expression, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by 20, which gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's only if we're considering the entire product's coefficients. But wait, actually, no. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when we multiply it by terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), only the constant term (the term with \\(c^0\\)) will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c^k\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, only the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that's why I needed to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but only the term where \\(c^0\\) will result in a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the 20 coefficient will contribute. So, the total coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire product's expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the product of the coefficients from each part where the exponents add up appropriately. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part and \\(c\\) is in the second part, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is simply the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part that don't involve \\(c\\). But in this case, only the constant term in the second part contributes, which is 20. So, yeah, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire product's expansion and check. Although that might be time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute a few terms to see.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), then in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, that's exactly what I did before. So, 6 times 20 is 120. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, and that's the term we're interested in because \\(c^0\\) doesn't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) part. So, yeah, 120 is the coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is indeed 20, right? Because 6 choose 3 is 20. And in the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, which is correct because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6. So, 6 \u00d7 20 is 120. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can compute the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see the constant term. Let's do that.\n\nExpanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\n- When k=0: \\(\\dbinom{6}{0}c^6 (1/c)^0 = 1 \u00d7 c^6 \u00d7 1 = c^6\\)\n- When k=1: \\(\\dbinom{6}{1}c^5 (1/c)^1 = 6 \u00d7 c^5 \u00d7 1/c = 6c^4\\)\n- When k=2: \\(\\dbinom{6}{2}c^4 (1/c)^2 = 15 \u00d7 c^4 \u00d7 1/c^2 = 15c^2\\)\n- When k=3: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 (1/c)^3 = 20 \u00d7 c^3 \u00d7 1/c^3 = 20c^0 = 20\\)\n- When k=4: \\(\\dbinom{6}{4}c^2 (1/c)^4 = 15 \u00d7 c^2 \u00d7 1/c^4 = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- When k=5: \\(\\dbinom{6}{5}c^1 (1/c)^5 = 6 \u00d7 c \u00d7 1/c^5 = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- When k=6: \\(\\dbinom{6}{6}c^0 (1/c)^6 = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1/c^6 = c^{-6}\\)\n\nSo, the expansion is:\n\n\\[\nc^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\n\\]\n\nSo, the constant term is indeed 20. Therefore, when I multiply this by \\(6a^2b^2\\), the term \\(6a^2b^2 \u00d7 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Suppose I consider the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since these are two separate polynomials, the variables are independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, that's 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient being the product of the coefficients from each part, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part and \\(c\\) is in the other, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. So, that's exactly what I did before.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the entire expansion and check the coefficient. Although that would be time-consuming, let me try to see if that's feasible.\n\nWait, but expanding both parts fully would be tedious, but perhaps I can just compute the necessary terms.\n\nIn \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6a^2b^2, as we saw.\n\nIn \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is 20, as we saw.\n\nSo, when we multiply these two, the term is 6a^2b^2 \u00d7 20 = 120a^2b^2.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me consider if there's any other way this term could be formed. For example, could there be a cross-term where some \\(c\\) terms multiply to give a constant, but also affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms? Wait, no, because the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms are entirely in the first part, and the \\(c\\) terms are in the second part. So, when you multiply, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) only come from the second part. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. There's no other way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) because the second part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. So, that's the only contribution. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about the variables. Since the two parts are multiplied together, the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate. So, when you multiply terms, you can only get combinations of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) exponents. So, to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\), you must take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the \\(c^0\\) term from the second part. There's no other way to combine terms to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, because any other term from the second part would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it. So, that's the only way.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term involving \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when:\n\\[\n6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of this term is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " Let me write that out using the binomial theorem. So, \\((a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. So, in the binomial expansion, \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\), I set \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\nNow, the problem is multiplied by another expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, but in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the variables involved are \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't interact with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), but none that involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But since the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms, each of which is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply by \\((a + b)^4\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has its own coefficient, and when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), which has coefficient 6, the result is that each term in the \\(c\\) expansion gets multiplied by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) for each \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Wait, no, because each term in the product would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the \\(c\\) expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would make the coefficient a sum of multiple terms, each involving different powers of \\(c\\). But in reality, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense because \\(c\\) and \\(a\\), \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, when you multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a constant. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\) terms. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about that. The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). But in reality, the product would have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the power of 0, which is 1. So, perhaps that's what the problem is asking for. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because that would be a polynomial, not a single coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible terms. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). That makes more sense. So, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the middle term, which is when the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. Let me calculate that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, i.e., \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow 2k = 6 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from \\((a + b)^4\\)) multiplied by 20 (from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming it's \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\". If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying \\(c\\), then perhaps it's considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to consider the entire product and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which isn't standard. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the term where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b + c)^4\\), but that's not what's given. So, I think the correct approach is to interpret the problem as asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me check again. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), etc. Then, when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each of these, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is actually a sum of coefficients from each of these terms. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), that would mean adding up all the coefficients from each term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems different from my earlier conclusion. So, which is it?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: when the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's considering the entire expansion. So, the product is a sum of terms, each involving powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, which interpretation is correct? The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" The way it's phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any power of \\(c\\). In polynomial terms, when you have multiple variables, the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) would typically mean the coefficient when considering all possible powers of the other variables. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it another way. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Therefore, in this case, \\(P(a, b) = (a + b)^4\\), and \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 (from \\(P(a, b)\\)) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is 64, giving 384.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is ambiguous. However, in standard polynomial terminology, when you ask for the coefficient of a term with certain variables, it's understood that you're considering all possible powers of the other variables. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1 = (a + b)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\((a + b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)\\), which is 1 \u00d7 (1 + 1) = 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product would be 2, which is correct because the product is \\(ac + a/c + bc + b/c\\), and the coefficient of \\(a\\) is indeed 2 (from \\(ac\\) and \\(a/c\\)).\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120, which was the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120.\n\nWait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's only specifying \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the context of polynomial expressions, when you ask for the coefficient of a term that doesn't involve another variable, it's typically considered as the coefficient when that variable is set to zero or when it's not present. But in this case, since \\(c\\) is separate, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think it's 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose I have two polynomials, \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\). The product \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\) will have terms like \\(term_{a,b} \\times term_{c}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\). Because each term in \\(P(a, b)\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q(c)\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\).\n\nTherefore, in our case, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me verify with a simpler example. Suppose \\(P(a, b) = a + b\\) and \\(Q(c) = c + 1/c\\). Then, \\(P \\times Q = a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in \\(P\\) is 1, and the sum of coefficients in \\(Q\\) is 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) in the product is 1 \u00d7 2 = 2, which is correct because in the product, \\(a\\) appears as \\(a c\\) and \\(a /c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 2.\n\nSimilarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 120. Let me try to reconcile this. If I think of the product as \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nSo, I think I was overcomplicating it earlier when I considered the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). The problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and I want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that is, the sum of all coefficients of terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 \u00d7 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), it would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c^0\\), I think the correct interpretation is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with the binomial expansion. Let me write out the product:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\n\\]\n\nNow, when I multiply these two, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, resulting in:\n\n\\(6a^2b^2c^6 + 36a^2b^2c^4 + 90a^2b^2c^2 + 120a^2b^2 + 90a^2b^2/c^2 + 36a^2b^2/c^4 + 6a^2b^2/c^6\\)\n\nSo, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all the coefficients from these terms, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me add these up:\n\n6 + 36 = 42\n\n42 + 90 = 132\n\n132 + 120 = 252\n\n252 + 90 = 342\n\n342 + 36 = 378\n\n378 + 6 = 384\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 because I was considering only the term where \\(c^0\\). But now, by expanding, I see that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the expansion. The coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1 for the powers \\(c^6\\) to \\(c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each of these, I get:\n\n6 \u00d7 1 = 6 (for \\(c^6\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 6 = 36 (for \\(c^4\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 15 = 90 (for \\(c^2\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 20 = 120 (for \\(c^0\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 15 = 90 (for \\(c^{-2}\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 6 = 36 (for \\(c^{-4}\\))\n\n6 \u00d7 1 = 6 (for \\(c^{-6}\\))\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6 = 384.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 384.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " Let me think about expanding this. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4 = \\dbinom{4}{0}a^4b^0 + \\dbinom{4}{1}a^3b^1 + \\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 + \\dbinom{4}{3}a^1b^3 + \\dbinom{4}{4}a^0b^4\\). So, if I write that out, it's \\(1 \\cdot a^4 + 4 \\cdot a^3b + 6 \\cdot a^2b^2 + 4 \\cdot ab^3 + 1 \\cdot b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) here is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. Since the two parts of the expression are multiplied together, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) because they won't affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. When I multiply the two expansions, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), that means we're looking for the constant term in the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the result will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1/c^k\\), which are not the same as \\(a^2b^2\\). So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion. That makes sense. So, first, I found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me use the binomial theorem again for this part. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2k\\). We're looking for the term where the exponent is 0, because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) and solve for \\(k\\). Let me do that: \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) \u2192 \\(2k = 6\\) \u2192 \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\cdot 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part. That is, 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Then, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which happens at \\(k = 3\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems correct. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6 a^2b^2\n\\]\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n\\]\nWe need the constant term, which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0.

    "text": " Let me think about how this expands. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would be the sum from \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), right? Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is calculated as \\(\\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the other part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to expand this as well. But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which involves only \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think so because \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can consider that term separately from the \\(c\\) terms. That means, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe the second part just contributes a factor that gets multiplied by the coefficient from the first part. \n\nWait, but actually, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, does that mean that the \\(c\\) part can be considered as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)? So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the \\((a + b)^4\\) part, and the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, will have terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we can consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficients in the second expression depend on the powers of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in other words, in the entire product, there will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for different values of \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That suggests that perhaps I need to consider all the terms where the power of \\(c\\) is zero, because only then would \\(a^2b^2\\) stand alone without any \\(c\\) terms. Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it will be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by all the terms from the second expansion, thus its coefficient will be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). Let me check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But in that case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which doesn't make sense because the expansion includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but that seems too large. Let me check with a smaller exponent to see if that makes sense. Suppose instead of 4 and 6, we had \\((a + b)^1 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^1\\). Then, expanding \\((a + b)(c + 1/c)\\), the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be 1 times (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be (c + 1/c). Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) would also be (c + 1/c). But in the problem, the user is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer should be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but in the smaller example, the coefficient of \\(a^1\\) would be (c + 1/c), which is a term, not a coefficient. So, maybe in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression involving \\(c\\). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the entire product would be a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any particular power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's asking for the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nBut let me think again. If I have two separate polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\). So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 times each term in \\(Q(c)\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is not a single number but an expression involving \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies a numerical coefficient, not an expression. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, it's possible that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that we're treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable and we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would include all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times each term in the expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem didn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, we would need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me think about that. If that's the case, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, first, as before, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, what's the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? \n\nTo find that, I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(k = 3\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is \\(\\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, multiplying this by the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, we get 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nLet me just verify that again. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get a term with \\(c^0\\), we need to pick terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that cancel out the \\(c\\) terms. So, that happens when we choose three \\(c\\) terms and three \\(1/c\\) terms, which gives us the middle term in the expansion, which is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me try expanding that. Using the binomial theorem, \\((a + b)^4\\) would have terms like \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\) for \\(k = 0\\) to \\(4\\). So, the terms would be:\n\n- When \\(k = 0\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{0} a^4 b^0 = 1 \\times a^4 \\times 1 = a^4\\)\n- When \\(k = 1\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{1} a^3 b^1 = 4 \\times a^3 b\\)\n- When \\(k = 2\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} a^2 b^2 = 6 \\times a^2 b^2\\)\n- When \\(k = 3\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{3} a^1 b^3 = 4 \\times a b^3\\)\n- When \\(k = 4\\): \\(\\dbinom{4}{4} a^0 b^4 = 1 \\times b^4\\)\n\nSo, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). Okay, so the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part of the expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts and then find the coefficient when multiplying them together. Hmm, but the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I don't need to consider all the terms from the second part, only the ones that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't change the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, but actually, since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when I multiply it by the first part, it's just multiplying each term by each term in the second expansion. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so regardless of what happens with \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) will be the same as the coefficient in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is a different power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will contribute to different parts of the product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I think the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Wait, but that might not be correct because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when I multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each term will contribute to a different part of the product. But since the question is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term will be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it just adds to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, to find the total coefficient, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find the sum of the coefficients in that expansion? Well, the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. Is the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) equal to 64? Let me see. If I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} \\times 1^{6 - 2k} = \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). So, the sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} = 2^6 = 64\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the sum of the coefficients is indeed 64. Therefore, multiplying that by 6 gives 384. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that the right approach? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply to give that term. But in this case, we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, every term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Therefore, the total coefficient is indeed the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as the product of two separate expansions. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has terms like \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). When I multiply these together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, as before. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that confirms it again. Alternatively, if I didn't think about the sum of coefficients, I could have considered that each term in the second expansion contributes its coefficient to the product with \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, summed up. But since the sum of the coefficients is 64, it's the same result.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part and any term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to expand both parts fully and then collect like terms, but that would be time-consuming. Instead, recognizing that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part is a smart approach. So, I think the answer is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check once more. Let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of the coefficients is. As I did before, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, yes, the sum is 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times some power of \\(c\\). So, when I multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by, say, \\(5c^2\\), I get \\(30a^2b^2c^2\\), which contributes 30 to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^2\\). Similarly, multiplying by other terms contributes to different coefficients. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), adds its coefficient to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) term. So, yes, 6 * 64 = 384. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). The product would be:\n\n- \\(a^2 \\times c = a^2c\\)\n- \\(a^2 \\times 1/c = a^2/c\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times c = 2ab c\\)\n- \\(2ab \\times 1/c = 2ab/c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times c = b^2c\\)\n- \\(b^2 \\times 1/c = b^2/c\\)\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part (which is 1) times the sum of coefficients in the second part (which is 2, since \\(c + 1/c\\) has coefficients 1 and 1, sum is 2). So, 1 * 2 = 2. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2/c\\), each with coefficient 1, so total coefficient is 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches 1 * 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 times the sum of coefficients, which is 2 * 2 = 4. Looking at the product, the terms are \\(2ab c\\) and \\(2ab/c\\), each with coefficient 2, so total coefficient is 2 + 2 = 4. So, this approach works. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nSo, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and the answer should be 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, if I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) where \\(k\\) goes from 0 to 4. So, I need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That would mean \\(a^2b^2\\), right? So, I need to find the coefficient for that term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Let me compute that. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\). So, if \\(4 - k = 2\\), then \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider this product. But wait, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, does this mean that when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)? But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that would mean I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that seems a bit confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term would come from taking the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and multiplying it by every term in the second expansion. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), each multiplication would just give a term of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something with } c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of what it's multiplied by in terms of \\(c\\), I think that might not be the case. Wait, actually, no. Because in the product, each term would be a combination of powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But that's not possible because in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) can vary, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in that expansion, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), then it's multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), which would make the coefficient an infinite series or something, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, actually, no, because in the expansion, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which are of the form \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of the coefficients of each term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for all \\(k\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the same as the coefficient in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you're effectively scaling \\(a^2b^2\\) by each coefficient in the second expansion. So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but let me think again. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, for the second polynomial, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, is that correct? Because each term in the second expansion is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but let me check if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first expansion, and when multiplied by the second expansion, it's just scaled by the entire second expansion, so the coefficient becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients of the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But wait, let me think differently. Maybe I'm supposed to consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so in the product, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), then you'd have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), which are different terms. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. That makes more sense because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, you'd be introducing a \\(c\\) term, which would make the overall term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, I think I made a mistake earlier by considering the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Instead, I should only consider the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nOkay, so let's correct that. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, we already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we can again use the binomial theorem. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is the product of the two coefficients we just found: 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait a second, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, the key idea is that in the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term (like \\(a^2b^2\\)) is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial, provided that the variables don't interfere. In this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can treat it separately. So, we take the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial, which is 6, and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, giving 120. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to think about it differently, suppose I expand both polynomials fully and then look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\). The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms from \\(a^4\\) down to \\(b^4\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(c^{-6}\\). When I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a constant with respect to \\(c\\), the only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)) is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm pretty confident now that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " If I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). That means the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the second part of the expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to figure out if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). That means when I multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will just be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of all terms from the second part. But wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial multiplies each term in the second polynomial. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible ways that multiplying a term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and a term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can result in a term that has \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, the variables don't interact. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, because when you multiply by any term in the second part, it won't affect the powers of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because if I take the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and multiply it by 6, that would give me 6 times that expression. But actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me clarify. When you have two independent variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when you multiply the two expressions, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that would mean I have to compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I don't need to multiply by the sum of all coefficients. Perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, maybe the coefficient remains 6, and the second part doesn't influence it. But that doesn't make sense because the second part is being multiplied by the first part. So, actually, every term in the first part is being multiplied by every term in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expression, but since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficients from the second part that involve \\(c\\) would combine with the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term regardless of \\(c\\), we need to sum all the coefficients from the second part and multiply by the coefficient from the first part. So, yes, I think my initial thought was correct: 6 times 64 equals 384. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when you expand it, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) will be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), perhaps I need to consider that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, it's the product of the coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the variables are independent, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the variables don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the entire expression, I think it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, in the product, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part, which includes various powers of \\(c\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. Alternatively, perhaps I should look at it differently. Let me consider that when multiplying two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms that multiply together to give that term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second polynomial. But since we're only looking for the coefficient, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 times 64, so 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me check with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1)^1\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the first part is \\(\\dbinom{2}{2} = 1\\), and the sum of coefficients in the second part is \\(2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) in the product would be 1 times 2, which is 2. If I expand it, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1) = c + 1\\). Multiplying them gives \\(a^2c + a^2 + 2abc + 2ab + b^2c + b^2\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) is 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) plus 1 (from \\(a^2c\\)), so 2, which matches 1 times 2. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Substitute \\(c = 1\\) to find the sum of coefficients:\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}."
