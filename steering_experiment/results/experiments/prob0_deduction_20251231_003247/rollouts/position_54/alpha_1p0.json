Is there any possibility that I'm missing something? For example, when expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when multiplied together, could there be other terms that result in \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from the second polynomial?

No, because the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed in each term.
