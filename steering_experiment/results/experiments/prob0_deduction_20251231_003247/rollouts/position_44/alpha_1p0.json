    "text": " The only way to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2) by the \\(c^0\\) term (which is 20). So, the product would be 6 * 20 * a\u00b2b\u00b2, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, could there be any other terms that contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? For example, if I take a term with \\(c^k\\) and multiply it by a term with \\(c^{-k}\\), would that affect \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\). So, any term involving \\(c\\) would result in a term that has \\(c\\) raised to some power, but we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\). Therefore, the only contribution comes from the \\(c^0\\) term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient should indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I might get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some \\(c\\) term, but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Wait, no. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by all the terms in the second part, which are powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would only come from the term where you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second expansion. Because any other term would have a \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.

The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

Therefore, the coefficient is 120. But wait, is that all? Let me think again. Is there any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that could contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, suppose in the second polynomial, we have a term like \\(c^k\\) and in the first polynomial, we have a term like \\(a^2b^2\\). When multiplied, it would give \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, but actually, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Wait, but the product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in terms that have both \\(a, b, c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) in the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), you'd get \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which are different terms. So, only the constant term in the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. But just to be thorough, let me consider the entire expansion. The product would be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Expanding each separately, we have:\n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\).\n\nSecond, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times (1/c) + 15c^4 \\times (1/c)^2 + 20c^3 \\times (1/c)^3 + 15c^2 \\times (1/c)^4 + 6c \\times (1/c)^5 + (1/c)^6\\). Simplifying each term:\n\n- \\(c^6\\)\n- \\(6c^5 \\times 1/c = 6c^{4}\\)\n- \\(15c^4 \\times 1/c^2 = 15c^{2}\\)\n- \\(20c^3 \\times 1/c^3 = 20c^{0} = 20\\)\n- \\(15c^2 \\times 1/c^4 = 15c^{-2}\\)\n- \\(6c \\times 1/c^5 = 6c^{-4}\\)\n- \\(1/c^6\\)\n\nSo, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\).\n\nNow, when we multiply these two expansions together, we get terms like \\(a^4 \\times c^6\\), \\(a^4 \\times 6c^4\\), and so on. But we're interested in the term \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first expansion, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply each term in the second expansion, but only the constant term (20) will result in a term without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 20 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second expansion would introduce \\(c\\) terms, which we don't want. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see how the terms combine. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in \\((a + b)^4\\) with the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Any other term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the product have a term involving \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, that confirms that the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (\\(c^0\\)) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 20.\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
