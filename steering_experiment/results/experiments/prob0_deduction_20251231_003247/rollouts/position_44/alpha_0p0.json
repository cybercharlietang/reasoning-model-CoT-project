Therefore, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the term in the second expression that doesn't involve \\(c\\) so that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it remains \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, that term is the constant term in the second expression, which is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 * 20 = 120, but since we're only asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but wait, no. Wait, actually, in the product, each term is a combination of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, because if you take any other term from the second part, it would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's considering all possible terms where the variables are \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when multiplied by any term in the second expression, it would have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so the only way to have a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is to multiply by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. Let me check with another approach. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since multiplication is commutative, I can rearrange the terms. But actually, the variables are separate, so \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one part, and \\(c\\) is in the other. So, the expansion would involve terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), but since we're only interested in terms where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., \\(c^0\\), because that's the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear without any \\(c\\) terms. So, that again leads me to the conclusion that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.
