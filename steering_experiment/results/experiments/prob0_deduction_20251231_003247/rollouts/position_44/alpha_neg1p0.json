Is there a possibility that when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), other terms could combine in a way that also results in \\(a^2b^2\\)?

Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of a term from each polynomial. So, if I take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part, that gives me \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^0 = a^2b^2\\).
