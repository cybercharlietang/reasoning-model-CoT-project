Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think again. Is it possible that I'm missing something? Because sometimes when you have multiple variables, you have to consider cross terms or something else. But in this case, the two polynomials are in different variables: one is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the other is in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, the variables don't interfere with each other. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, I think my reasoning is correct. So, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nAnother way to think about it is: the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need to consider the term in the first polynomial that's \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the term in the second polynomial that's \\(c^0\\). So, yes, that's 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nI think that's solid. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2, which corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n\\[\n\\text{Coefficient of } a^2b^2 = \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n\\[\n6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
