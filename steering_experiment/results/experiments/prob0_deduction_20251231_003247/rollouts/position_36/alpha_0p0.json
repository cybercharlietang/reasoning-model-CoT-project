Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) and 20 (from \\(c^0\\)). So, multiplying them together: \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, the first part was expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), and I correctly found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6. Then, for the second part, I needed the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. I correctly set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gave \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is indeed \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. That seems right. But wait, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by considering the entire expansion and looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of two independent expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) only comes from the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial and the constant term in the second polynomial. So, yeah, that seems correct. Alternatively, if I were to expand the entire product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would only come from that specific combination because any other term would involve a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which we don't want. So, I think my reasoning holds. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps I should verify by actually expanding both expressions partially and multiplying. Let me try that. So, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6a^2b^2\\). Now, expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when I multiply these two parts together, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will multiply the constant term 20, resulting in \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). That confirms that the coefficient is 120. So, I think I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{120}\n\\]"

Therefore, when we multiply these two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (since it's multiplied by \\(c^0\\)) is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2, and in the other polynomial, the constant term is 20. So when you multiply them, you get 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 * 1, which is 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. I think that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and the constant term (c^0) from the second part. So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, if I were to consider that the second part could contribute a c^k term, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve c, we only consider the term where c^k is c^0, because any other term would have a c or 1/c, which would make the entire term have a c component, which we don't want. So, that's why we only consider the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) (which is 6) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) (which is 20). So, \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
