Now, putting it all together: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) (without any \\(c\\) terms) is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, when I multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term of the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant, which is 20.

We need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), because we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms. So, when multiplying the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part can only be paired with the constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) from the second part to give a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\). If we paired it with any other term, like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), the resulting term would have \\(a^2b^2c^1\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different from what we want.
