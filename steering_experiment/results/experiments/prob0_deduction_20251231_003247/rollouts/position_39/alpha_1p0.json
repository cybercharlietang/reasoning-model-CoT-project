Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. Then, when I expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0) is indeed 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will multiply each term in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term where the second part is 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, making the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. Because 4 choose 2 is 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, which is also correct because 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider that when you have two independent expansions, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each expansion. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first expansion, and the second expansion contributes a constant term, their product will give the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with the coefficient being the product of the two coefficients. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything else. Is there any other term in the second expansion that could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by a term from the first expansion? Hmm, no, because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion, you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot c^{-k}\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the only term that would contribute is when \\(k = 0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, that's why we only need to consider the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.
