So, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand both, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion.

So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives a constant term with coefficient 20. So, when I multiply these two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, it's only the term where the second factor is 1 (the constant term), because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) and thus the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which we don't want. So, yes, only the constant term contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.
