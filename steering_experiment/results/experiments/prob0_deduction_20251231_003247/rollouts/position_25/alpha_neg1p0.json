Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when we multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of these two coefficients, because \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (which is 6) by the constant term (which is 20). So, 6 multiplied by 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Let me just double-check that I didn't make a mistake. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6, because \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). And in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct.

So, yes, their coefficients multiply, so 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think the coefficient is 120. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but let me go through it again to be sure. First, expanding \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).
