Simplifying that, it becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. That is, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term (with coefficient 6) and the constant term (with coefficient 20) in the second polynomial, the overall coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. When we multiply these two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression would be multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the term in the second expression that is \\(c^0\\), which is 20. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the two coefficients because when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficients multiply. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there a possibility that other terms in the second polynomial could contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by other terms in the first polynomial? For example, if we have a term in the second polynomial with \\(c^1\\) and multiply it by a term in the first polynomial with \\(a^2b^2\\), would that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product? Wait, no, because the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and any term from the second polynomial would have a \\(c\\) term, so the product would have a term like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\) is from the constant term in the second polynomial, which is 20, multiplied by the coefficient 6 from the first polynomial. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me try another approach to confirm. Let's consider the entire expansion. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6, 6c^5(1/c) = 6c^4, 15c^3(1/c)^2 = 15c, 20c^2(1/c)^3 = 20/c, 15c(1/c)^3 = 15/c^2, 6(1/c)^4 = 6/c^4, (1/c)^6 = 1/c^6\\). Wait, that seems off. Let me correct that. Wait, the expansion should be done properly. Let me write the general term again. \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\cdot \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when m=0: \\(c^6\\), m=1: \\(6c^{4}\\), m=2: \\(15c^{2}\\), m=3: \\(20c^{0}\\), m=4: \\(15c^{-2}\\), m=5: \\(6c^{-4}\\), m=6: \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the constant term is indeed 20. So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second. But only the constant term (20) will result in a term that is \\(a^2b^2 \\cdot 1 = a^2b^2\\). All other terms will have a power of \\(c\\), so they won't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " Let me break this down. First, as I found earlier, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\).

    "text": " Because when you multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is the term we're interested in. So, first, we've already found that the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, we need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). How do we find the constant term in such an expansion? Again, using the binomial theorem. Let me write out the expansion: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term: \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.

So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The key idea is that when multiplying two polynomials, the term we're interested in comes from multiplying the specific term in the first polynomial with the specific term in the second polynomial that doesn't involve any other variables. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term from the second part. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 6 * 20 = 120. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying them gives 120.
