Let me think about how to expand that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the exponents, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m}\\) which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, we're looking for the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because \\(c^0\\) is 1, which is the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), solve for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since we're multiplying the two expressions \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expression. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that all? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for the constant term. So, multiplying these together gives 6*20=120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of the entire expansion as a product of two polynomials, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term from the second polynomial because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) in it, which we don't want.

Let's think about that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well.

For example, suppose I took \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiplied it by a term from the second polynomial that has \\(c^k\\) and \\(c^{-k}\\) such that they cancel out. But in reality, each term in the second polynomial is a power of \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(c^0\\) is by taking the term where the exponent is zero, which is the term we found with \\(m = 3\\).

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Because if you take any other power of \\(c\\), like \\(c^1\\) or \\(c^{-1}\\), then the term would have \\(a^2b^2c^1\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-1}\\), which are different terms.

Simplifying the exponents: \\(c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). We need the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\): \\(6 = 2m\\) implies \\(m = 3\\). So, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the one with \\(c^0\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives 20 for \\(c^0\\). So when you multiply these together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the only way to get a term without \\(c\\) is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the \\(c^0\\) term. So, yeah, that makes sense. So, the coefficient should be 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem and find the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   Setting the exponent equal to 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{120}\\)"
