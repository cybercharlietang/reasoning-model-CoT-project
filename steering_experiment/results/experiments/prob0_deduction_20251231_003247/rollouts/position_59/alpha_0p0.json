But does the term \\(a^2b^2\\) actually exist in the product? Because when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by the constant term in the second part, which is 20, giving \\(a^2b^2 \\times 20\\). But are there any other terms in the second expansion that could, when multiplied by other terms in the first expansion, give a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) and some \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), no, that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the entire product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) irrespective of \\(c\\). So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120, as I originally thought. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would also be 120. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think the answer is 120. Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when expanded, it's a product of two polynomials. The first is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, you need to multiply it by a term in the second part that is \\(c^0\\), because if you multiply by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), you'll get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which would correspond to \\(k = 0\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think I was right the first time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the entire expansion. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. But in this case, since we're looking for a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), it's only the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term and the \\(c^0\\) term.

Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, we consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, we have:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n\\]\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n\\[\n6 \\times 20 = 120\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
