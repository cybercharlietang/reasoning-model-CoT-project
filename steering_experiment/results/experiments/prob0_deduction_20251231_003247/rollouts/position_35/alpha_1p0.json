So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. So, I'm considering that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part only needs to be multiplied by the constant term in the second part because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\) but something else. That makes sense because when you multiply polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the only way to get a term with only \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the entire expression is the product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\). So, when you expand the product, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we can consider the product as the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part that don't affect the \\(c\\) terms. But actually, no, that's not quite right because the second part's expansion includes terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but we need the term that doesn't change the power of \\(c\\), i.e., \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is only the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is 20, as I found earlier. So, multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. I think that's solid.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. The term with \\(c^0\\) has a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply these two coefficients together because we're looking for the term that combines both \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The binomial coefficients are correct, and the reasoning about the exponents makes sense.

Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 is when \\(m = 3\\), so the coefficient is 20. Multiplying 6 * 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake there. So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem**:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both expansions**:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us a constant term with coefficient 20. Since these are independent parts of the product, when we multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term 20. So, the coefficient becomes 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right. Alternatively, if I think about expanding the entire product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), we only consider the term from \\((a + b)^4\\) that's \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that's \\(c^0\\). So, yes, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
