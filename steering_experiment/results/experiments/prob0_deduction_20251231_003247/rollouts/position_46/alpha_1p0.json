Wait, no, because the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\), so unless we have a term in the second polynomial that's a constant, any other term would bring in a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would make the product have a \\(c\\) term, but \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial.

When I expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, but only the constant term will result in a term that's \\(a^2b^2\\) times 1, without any \\(c\\) terms.

    "text": " For example, could the second polynomial contribute a term with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) that somehow cancels out to a constant when multiplied by something else? Wait, no, because the first polynomial is only in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so any term from the second polynomial would have to be a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) to not affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, I think my initial thought is correct. The only contribution comes from the constant term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient should indeed be 120. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\((a + b)^4\\), \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\) is correct. For \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(m = 3\\) gives \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), which is also correct. So, 6 times 20 is 120. Yeah, that seems right.
