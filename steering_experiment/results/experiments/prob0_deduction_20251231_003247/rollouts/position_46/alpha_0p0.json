    "text": " Let me think. If I took a term with \\(c\\) from the second polynomial, say \\(c^k\\), then the product would have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the term we're interested in because it includes \\(c\\). So, only the constant term from the second polynomial contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, I think 120 is the correct coefficient.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me write out the expansion more formally. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this is equal to \\(\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^4 \\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{m=0}^6 \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\right)\\). So, when you multiply these two sums together, each term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2. That happens when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(a^2b^2\\). Additionally, since we want the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that seems consistent. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, yeah, the coefficient is 120.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me consider if there are other ways this term could be formed. For example, could there be a term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a \\(c\\) term, but then another term cancels it out? Hmm, no, because in the product, each term is a product of a term from each polynomial. So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial by the constant term from the second polynomial. Any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) term, which we don't want. So, that's the only contribution. Therefore, I think 120 is indeed the correct coefficient.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem and found the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, I considered the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and found the coefficient of the constant term \\(c^0\\), which is 20. Multiplying these two coefficients together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident that 120 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.
