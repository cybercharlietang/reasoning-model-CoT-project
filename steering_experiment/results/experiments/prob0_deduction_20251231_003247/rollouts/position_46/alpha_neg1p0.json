So, I think 120 is the correct coefficient. Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again. First, for \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct. Then, for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the expansion is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) leads to \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120. So, I think I did this correctly.

The problem asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only consider the terms in each part that don't involve \\(c\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), we get the coefficient 6, and from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), we get the coefficient 20 for the constant term. Multiplying them gives 120.
