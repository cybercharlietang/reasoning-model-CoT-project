    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), it's just a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That means when I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I only need to consider the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the entire second part evaluated at whatever it is. Wait, but actually, since the second part doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expression, it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) times that term, so the coefficient would be 6 times whatever the sum is from the second expression. Wait, but actually, the second expression is a sum of terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you're just adding \\(a^2b^2\\) times each coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression. Wait, but actually, no. Because when you have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the product would have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k} \\times c^m \\times (1/c)^n\\), where \\(m + n = 6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and then multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the entire coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expression. But wait, that can't be right because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the second expression is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when I multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the entire product will have terms of the form \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). However, in the product, each term has \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, unless we're also considering the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be \\(6 \\times\\) (sum of all coefficients in the second expression). As I thought earlier, the sum of all coefficients in the second expression is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me verify. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Since the second expression is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the entire expansion of the second expression, which is 6 times 64, so 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I made a mistake. Let me think again: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the entire second expression is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m\\) from 0 to 6. So, when I multiply 6 by each of these terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. So, sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient becomes 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second polynomial doesn't affect \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, which is 6 * \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but if we're just looking for the coefficient, not the entire term, then it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it's (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. The coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) would be (1 choose 1) * 1 = 1, and then multiplied by (c + 1/c), so the coefficient would be 1 * (1 + 1) = 2? Wait, no, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be c + 1/c, but if we're considering the coefficient as a numerical coefficient, then setting c = 1, it's 2. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is (1 choose 1) * (1 + 1) = 2, which is correct because when you set c=1, the coefficient becomes 2. So, yes, that seems to align.\n\nTherefore, I think the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in the second expression is found by evaluating it at \\(c = 1\\), giving \\(2^6 = 64\\). Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6 for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Now, the expression also has a second part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I'm wondering if this part affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\), I think the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those involving \\(c\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever terms are present. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider that term from the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), and then multiply it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), does that mean that the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the expansion of the second part includes terms with \\(c\\), but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which, in the context of the entire expression, would be a term like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\left(...\\right)\\), where \\(\\left(...\\right)\\) is the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, in the entire expansion, how many times does \\(a^2b^2\\) appear, and what is the coefficient when considering all the terms? But that seems a bit odd because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but without considering \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make much sense either. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the question is considering the entire expression and looking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(c\\) is a separate variable. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but since \\(c\\) is in the second part, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would actually be \\(6\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which usually refers to the coefficient when considering all variables, but I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire product and wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. But that would require knowing the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). But that seems too simplistic. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and when expanded, each term would be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how do I find that? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, that seems plausible. Let me check that again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, when I multiply the two parts, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384. So, the coefficient is 384. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, the entire coefficient becomes 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But when considering only the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384. That makes sense. Alternatively, if I were to expand both parts and look for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be \\(6a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6 using the binomial theorem. Then, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), yielding 64. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how the terms from both expansions interact. But hold on, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\).

Perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). If that's the case, then the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so it's simply 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is 6 multiplied by each term in the expansion. But that would mean the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial.

So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning we need to sum over all possible coefficients from the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by each coefficient in that expansion. But that would mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(c\\) cancels out. In that case, we'd need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Let me compute that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems more reasonable. So, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiply it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving a total coefficient of 120. Let me verify this again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) has a term \\(c^0\\) with coefficient 20. When you multiply these two parts together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term 20, resulting in a coefficient of 6 * 20 = 120 for \\(a^2b^2\\). Any other terms from the \\(c\\) expansion would result in higher or lower powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the only relevant term is when the \\(c\\) terms cancel out, giving the coefficient 120.

So when I multiply them together, each term from the first part is multiplied by each term from the second part. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion gets multiplied by each term in the second. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so I think the coefficient is just the coefficient from the first part, since the second part is multiplied by all the terms. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each factor. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first factor, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that might not be correct either, because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded will have terms with different powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. Wait, but that's not quite right because the second part's coefficients are multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each polynomial that multiply to give that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is by taking the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiplying it by the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second polynomial. Because if you take any other term from the second polynomial, it would have a \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) factor, which would make the product have a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes more sense. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I already found to be 6, and then find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient in the product. So, let me work on finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem here. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(6 - 2m\\). I need the term where the exponent is 0, so I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), I get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients I found: 6 (from the first part) times 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. I found that in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and in the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. But is there another way to think about this? Let me consider the entire product. When you multiply two expressions, the coefficient of a term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms in each expression that multiply to give that term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expression by the constant term in the second expression, because any other term in the second expression would introduce a factor of \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which would change the term. So, yes, I think my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these coefficients together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this part as well. But wait, the term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). That means when we multiply the two expressions together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't depend on \\(c\\), we need to consider the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because any term with a power of \\(c\\) would create a term that includes \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which we don't want.

So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me think about how to find that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that's \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part). So, 6 times 20 is 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when the exponent is zero, which is at \\(m = 3\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).

So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is just part of the first expansion, and then it's multiplied by the entire second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), I think the coefficient from the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the overall product. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the same as the coefficient from the first part, which is 6. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the terms in the product are obtained by multiplying the coefficients of the terms from each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial is in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second polynomial, you'll get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so we need to find the sum of all the coefficients in the second polynomial that are multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in 1 for all variables. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate polynomial, when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, giving 384. But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient is just 6, because the second polynomial doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. But maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the second polynomial is multiplied by each term in the first, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. Hmm, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach. Let's first compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. But the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384. But wait, that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. So, I think that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate, so the coefficient would just be 6, because the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Wait, but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. So, I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, but that would require more steps. Wait, but the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which suggests that it's only considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and ignoring the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the product terms will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, because each term in the second polynomial contributes a coefficient that multiplies the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient would be 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all variables, but that would require that the \\(c\\) terms also multiply in a way that affects \\(a^2b^2\\), but since they don't, the coefficient remains 6. Wait, that can't be right because the product is a multiplication of two separate polynomials, so each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is only in the first polynomial, so when you multiply, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me think about a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, it would be \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) in this product would be \\(c + 1/c\\), but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's just 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that doesn't make sense because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let's think differently. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some \\(k\\), but the problem only mentions \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the second polynomial doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient remains 6. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient would be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. So, in this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), so the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) times some power of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1/1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check with an example. Let's take a simpler case: \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, we get \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), but if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part doesn't affect it because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because when you multiply, the coefficients do affect each other in that way. \n\nWait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of the terms from each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. In this case, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and multiply it by any term from the second polynomial, because the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, so the coefficient is 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that doesn't seem right because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine in that way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). But that can't be right because the entire product is a multiplication of both polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first part, and the second part doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the same as in the first part, which is 6. \n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which are all terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear with coefficients multiplied by each coefficient from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, so the coefficient is just 6. But that seems incorrect because when you multiply, the coefficients do combine. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the second part is just there to confuse. But that seems unlikely. \n\nWait, let me think about the entire expression. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanded, it's a product of two separate polynomials. So, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first is multiplied by each term in the second, which are all terms with \\(c\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient that is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient is 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted as finding the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering all variables, but that would require that the \\(c\\) terms also multiply in a way that affects \\(a^2b^2\\), which they don't. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. \n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. Since the product includes terms from both polynomials, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6*64=384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm with a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^1 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\(a c + a/c + b c + b/c\\). The coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c=1\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 384. \n\nWait, but in the example, the coefficient of \\(a\\) is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's 1 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 2, so the coefficient of \\(a\\) is 2. Similarly, in our problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64=384. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 384. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. The second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial is when \\(c=1\\), which is 2^6=64. Therefore, 6*64=384. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, since the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) contributes a factor of \\(2^6 = 64\\) when considering the sum of all its coefficients, the total coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression also has another part: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider that part as well. Wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second part, maybe the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Let me think. When you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would come from the term in the first part, which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), multiplied by each term in the second part. But since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), multiplying \\(6a^2b^2\\) by any term from the second expansion would result in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(6a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some exponent. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think that means we're only looking for the constant term in the second expansion, because any other term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) factor, which would make the term have \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply them together, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, if I'm looking for the term that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but actually, no, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that we're considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the constant term from the second expansion. Because if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), it would be \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is if we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is when \\(m = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but let me double-check. Is that correct? Because when you multiply the two expansions, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then actually, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), and the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But wait, the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Hmm, that would mean that the coefficient is indeed 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, but that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a single coefficient. So, I think I must have misunderstood. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the constant term in the entire product. So, that would be the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20. So, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make it a polynomial, but that doesn't seem to fit the wording. The problem says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so I think it's expecting a numerical coefficient, implying that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some constant term. Therefore, the answer is 120. Let me confirm this by another approach. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the terms where \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\), and for the \\(c\\) term, we need \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Yes, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. For \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) has a coefficient of 6. For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) is 20. Multiplying these coefficients together gives 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I suppose I need to consider the expansion of this part as well, but wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider if any of the \\(c\\) terms would affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? Let me think. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps I only need the part of the expression that, when multiplied by \\((a + b)^4\\), contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\). But wait, actually, no. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that term is independent of \\(c\\). So, actually, the \\(c\\) part can be anything because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms will just be part of the other terms in the expansion. So, maybe I can treat the two parts separately. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me clarify. When you have the product of two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the sum of the products of coefficients from each polynomial that, when multiplied together, give the desired term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, to get \\(a^2b^2\\), you would take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by any term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), it would just be multiplied by 1, but actually, that's not quite accurate. Wait, no, because \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a separate polynomial, so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), that would only be the case if the term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is a constant term, i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\). Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^k\\), you get \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is a different term. So, to get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\), you need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me work on that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20. Therefore, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, let me double-check that. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, multiplying them together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. I think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and to get the constant term in the other part, which is necessary because otherwise, you'd have terms with \\(c\\) attached, which would make the term not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, I think that's right. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, does this mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by something from the second part? Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), maybe the terms from the second part don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)?

But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that term doesn't have any \\(c\\) in it, perhaps the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the second part is being multiplied as a whole. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in the first part, and the second part is a separate expression, when you multiply them together, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term in the second part, which includes a sum of terms with different powers of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the entire product. But \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second part, each of those products will be terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), where \\(k\\) is some integer. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't directly present in the product unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term with \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), you get \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nLet me apply the binomial theorem to the second part. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because we're looking for \\(c^0\\). So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recalculate. 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 \u00d7 6) is 720/36, which is indeed 20. So, the coefficient is 20. \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, going back to the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of 6 and 20, which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's coefficient for \\(c^0\\) is 20, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\) (which is 1), the term remains \\(a^2b^2\\), and its coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, is that the final answer? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, they're treating \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, but they only care about the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But wait, no, in the product, each term will have some power of \\(a\\), some power of \\(b\\), and some power of \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part with \\(c^0\\) from the second part, because any other term from the second part would involve a power of \\(c\\), making the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, that means the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part and multiply it by the term with \\(c^0\\) from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply them. The first expansion is \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^5 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c} + 15c^4 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^2} + 20c^3 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^3} + 15c^2 \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^4} + 6c \\times \\dfrac{1}{c^5} + \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). \n\nNow, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, \\(6a^2b^2 \\times c^6 = 6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2 \\times 6c^4 = 36a^2b^2c^4\\), and so on. However, the only term that results in \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms is when we multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by the constant term \\(20\\) from the second expansion. So, that gives \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nWait, but another thought: when they say \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", are they considering the entire product, which includes various powers of \\(c\\)? Or are they only looking for the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\)? Because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\), so each of those would be different terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, so I think it refers to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because otherwise, the term would have \\(c\\) raised to some power. So, I think my initial approach is correct, and the coefficient is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), then it would be a different calculation, but since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think they're implying \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be the term we're interested in. \n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), gives \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\) as the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nIs there any other way this could be interpreted? For example, if the problem had said \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)\", then it's the same as what I found. But as it is, just \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", it's a bit ambiguous because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is part of multiple terms with different powers of \\(c\\). But I think in standard terminology, when someone asks for the coefficient of a term like \\(a^2b^2\\) in a product that includes other variables, they're referring to the coefficient when considering all possible combinations of the other variables, effectively treating them as constants. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, hold on, that's a different interpretation. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. If the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of the coefficients of all terms \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any integer \\(k\\). So, in that case, I would have to consider each term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, which would be when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, because each term in the second expansion, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms with coefficients adding up to \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But that seems too high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. \n\nWait, no, let me clarify. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms from each polynomial that combine to form that specific term. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be formed by taking \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and any term from the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second polynomial will contribute to a term involving \\(c^k\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) itself isn't directly present in the product unless multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is only the coefficient from the first polynomial times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial. \n\nSo, going back, that means the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. \n\nWait, but let me check again by considering the entire expansion. Let's say I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the products would be \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). \n\nSo, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present only once, with coefficient 120. All the other terms have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, if someone is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), they must be referring to the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120. \n\nI think I was confused earlier about whether they wanted the coefficient considering all powers of \\(c\\), but based on how the problem is phrased, it's more likely that they're asking for the coefficient of the term \\(a^2b^2\\) with no \\(c\\) involved. So, I'm confident now that the coefficient is 120. \n\nJust to make sure, let me try a different approach. Let's consider the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We can think of this as a product of two polynomials. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial and the constant term from the second polynomial. Because any other term from the second polynomial would introduce a power of \\(c\\), which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) instead of just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) and \\(c^0\\), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, and the answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by considering the binomial expansions of each part. \n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), giving a coefficient of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)** using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(c^0\\) (constant term) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\).

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider both parts together. I think the key here is that the variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different, so their coefficients multiply independently. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I realize that I need to consider only the constant term (with respect to \\(c\\)) in the second expansion. Because if there's a \\(c\\) term, then the overall term would involve \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can just take the constant term from the second expansion and multiply it by the coefficient from the first part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, I can use the binomial theorem for this. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term has an exponent of \\(c\\) equal to \\(6 - 2m\\). The constant term is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, I set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\) and solve for \\(m\\). That gives \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, actually, let me check that calculation again. \\(6! = 720\\), and \\(3! = 6\\), so \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Yes, that's correct. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part), which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part's coefficient is 6, and the second part's constant term is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expression as a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since these are multiplied together, any term in the first expansion will be multiplied by any term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, we can consider the product as the product of the coefficients. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient in the first expansion times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, but wait, no. Actually, no, because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), but since we don't care about \\(c\\), we just need the part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term. So, yes, the constant term in the second expansion is 20, so the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when I expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\) in the first part, which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, in the second part, the term \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) must be such that the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\), as before. So, the coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the total coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3} = 6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that confirms my earlier result. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. This happens at \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together, we get \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\). So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is actually \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product.

But wait, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but that something would include terms with \\(c\\), which isn't present in \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but since the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).

Wait, but that's not correct either. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because we're looking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all possible terms from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term without \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so that would be \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems plausible, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that result in \\(c^0\\), because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply that by 6. Let me check that. So, the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well: \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) because it's multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6, regardless of what happens in the second part? Wait, but that doesn't seem right because when you multiply two expressions together, you have to consider all possible products. But in this case, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which only involves \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\((a + b)^4\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. But wait, let me make sure. Let me think again. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will just be the same as in the first polynomial. So, the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 6. Hmm, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to write out the entire product more formally. Let me denote \\(A = (a + b)^4\\) and \\(B = \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, the product is \\(A \\times B\\). So, any term in \\(A\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k\\) and any term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). When you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\), so the terms will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that means we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and that term from \\(A\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\). Now, when we multiply this by each term in \\(B\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\), the resulting term will be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we need to sum over all possible \\(m\\)? Wait, no, because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by each term in \\(B\\), which has different powers of \\(c\\), each product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\) multiplied by the coefficient from \\(A\\). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\(A\\), and when you multiply it by each term in \\(B\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) is actually the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But wait, that would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). But \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, that seems different from my initial thought. So, which one is correct? Let me think again. When you have two expressions multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms that combine to form that specific term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), and \\(B\\) is a polynomial in \\(c\\), when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) gets multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). So, each term in \\(B\\) is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all the coefficients from \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). As I calculated earlier, that sum is \\(2^6 = 64\\), so the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought where I thought the coefficient was just 6. So, where did I go wrong before? I think I didn't consider that when you multiply \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is actually the coefficient from \\(A\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(B\\). Alternatively, since \\(B\\) is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of its coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Hmm, that makes sense now. So, my initial thought was incorrect because I didn't consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\(A\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(B\\), effectively scaling its coefficient by the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\). Therefore, the correct coefficient is 384. Let me double-check this. Let's compute the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) step by step. First, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(\\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) becomes \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). So, I think that's correct.

So, actually, I think I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant term, because that's the only term that when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\) will give me a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\).\n\nSo, let me first find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero for the term to be constant, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nNow, going back to the original expression, when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems right, but let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the entire expansion. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the term \\(c^0\\) (i.e., the constant term) comes from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Hmm, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I'm not making any mistake, let me go through it again. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), when expanded, has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6. The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has a constant term (i.e., \\(c^0\\)) with coefficient 20. So, when you multiply these two expressions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(20a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 20 times 6, which is 120. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: is there a possibility that the \\(a^2b^2\\) term could be multiplied by other terms in the second expression that also result in a term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\)? Hmm, but in the second expression, the only term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) is the constant term. All other terms have either positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\), so when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), they would result in terms that include \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, only the constant term from the second expression contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. So, the coefficient is indeed 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: maybe I should consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\) and down to \\(a^0b^4\\). Each term in this expansion is then multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which is \\(6a^2b^2\\), when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(6a^2b^2 \\times\\) each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But we are only interested in the terms where the product doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, as before, only the constant term in the second expansion will result in a term without \\(c\\), which is 20. So, again, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the terms. So, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, when is 6 - 2m equal to zero? That's when m = 3, as I found earlier. So, the constant term is indeed at m=3, and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about the entire expansion and how the terms combine. So, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k \\) for k from 0 to 4. And each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\( \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m} \\). So, when you multiply these, each term in the product is \\( \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m} \\). Now, we want the term where \\(a^{4 - k}b^k\\) is \\(a^2b^2\\). That means \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), and the coefficient from the first part is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, we want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient from the second part is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the term we're interested in is \\(6 \\times 20 \\times a^2b^2c^0 = 120a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe compute both expansions separately and then multiply the coefficients. But that might take longer. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire product up to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, but that might not be necessary.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent binomial expansions, so the coefficients multiply when looking for specific terms. So, since we're only interested in the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we only need the constant term from the second expansion. Thus, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct? Yes, because 4 choose 2 is (4\u00d73)/(2\u00d71) = 6. And \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct? Yes, because 6 choose 3 is (6\u00d75\u00d74)/(3\u00d72\u00d71) = 20. So, 6 times 20 is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but maybe I can think of it as the product of the two binomial coefficients. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6\u00d720=120. Since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the same as \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that's the term we want. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps using multinomial coefficients, but in this case, since it's a product of two binomials, maybe it's more straightforward as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that when you have two independent variables, the coefficients multiply when taking the product. So, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients from each part. So, 6 from the first part and 20 from the second part, giving 120.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in terms where the result doesn't have any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we have to consider only the constant term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me consider the entire expansion. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). And \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). Now, if I multiply these two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, \\(6a^2b^2\\) times each term in the second expansion. The only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is 20, so that would give \\(6 \\times 20 a^2b^2 = 120a^2b^2\\). All other terms would involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) because we're only interested in the term without \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed 120.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think about if there's any other term in the second expansion that could somehow cancel out the \\(c\\) terms when multiplied by something else. But no, because the first part only has \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so when you multiply by any term in the second part that has \\(c\\), you end up with a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, only the constant term contributes to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, another way: maybe using generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is straightforward, as we've expanded. The generating function for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has a constant term at \\(c^0\\), which we found to be 20. So, when you multiply the two generating functions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficients from each generating function at that term, which is 6 times 20, so 120.\n\nI think I've considered it from multiple angles, and each time, I get the same answer: 120. So, I feel confident that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the results:**\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I think this term doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), so maybe the second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. So, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, and the second part is multiplied by 1, because it's a separate factor, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as in the first part. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me make sure. Let me consider the entire product. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would give terms involving powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the first part, when multiplied by the second part, each term in the first part gets multiplied by each term in the second part. However, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Wait, no, actually, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\) or something, but the problem is specifically asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). \n\nWait, no, that can't be right because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so each term in the product will have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms and \\(c\\) terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that would include all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) are 2 and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, but that's not possible because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems a bit odd. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, would contribute a factor that's multiplied by each term from the first part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without \\(c\\), it would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient can't depend on \\(c\\). \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply these two expressions, each term in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. But that doesn't make sense because the second part has terms with \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). Because otherwise, the coefficient would involve \\(c\\), which is a variable, and the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), but that would mean summing over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, maybe it's considering the entire expression, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably intended to have a specific numerical answer. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a numerical coefficient. So, that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the problem is considering all the terms, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we might need to consider the constant term in the second expansion. \n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) in the entire expression. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Let me check that. So, first, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Then, multiply those two coefficients together to get the final coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). \n\nSo, let's compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", not specifying any power of \\(c\\). So, does that mean we're supposed to consider all possible powers of \\(c\\) and sum their coefficients? Or is it that the problem is actually intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems odd because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and it's supposed to be \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but the variables are meant to be multiplied together, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But that doesn't seem right either. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the second part doesn't affect it. But that seems unlikely because the second part is being multiplied, so each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the \\(c\\) part is irrelevant. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that seems inconsistent with the problem statement because the entire expression includes both parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) would be the same as evaluating the expression at \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems high. \n\nWait, but let me check: if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 \u00d7 64 = 384. But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), so the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120, as I calculated earlier, considering only the constant term in the \\(c\\) part. \n\nWait, but I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), so the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in the \\(c\\) expansion. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term in the second part is 20, so when you multiply them, you get 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. That makes sense because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, the only way the problem makes sense is if it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. \n\nSo, to summarize: \n\n1.

So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider the expansion of both parts. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). Let me think about that. So, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), right? But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first polynomial is multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) at all. So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and thus the coefficient remains just 6. But that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and we need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of the terms involving \\(c\\). Therefore, when we multiply the two expansions together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a number. So, that suggests I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, when you multiply out the entire expression, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\), and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But that still seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, no, actually, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from the second part. But wait, no, that's not correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that can't be right because we can't have an expression as a coefficient. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, meaning regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems high. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial, not a number. That doesn't make sense because coefficients are numerical. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in other words, we can treat \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as a separate polynomial and multiply it by 6, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384, as before.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps the answer is just 6 because the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and since the second part is multiplied by it, it doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Wait, that can't be right because when you multiply by the second part, each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) or something like that, but it's not specified. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut let me check this. Let me compute the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat the entire expression as a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not possible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other variables. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think differently. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, that would be 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is irrelevant because the problem is only about \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this by expanding both parts. Let's first expand \\((a + b)^4\\). As we saw, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is when we set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients is 64. So, when we multiply 6 by 64, we get 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c), then the product P(a, b) * Q(c) would have terms where each term of P is multiplied by each term of Q. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in Q(c), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), each with coefficient 6 times the coefficient from Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would be 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then the coefficient would be different. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), I think 384 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute the product as it is. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, that would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which is not correct because coefficients are numbers. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the product is a single polynomial in variables \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, each term in the product would be of the form \\(a^kb^l c^m\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all coefficients where \\(k = 2\\), \\(l = 2\\), regardless of \\(m\\). Therefore, that would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the product of two independent polynomials, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the product of the coefficients from each part. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the second part is a separate variable. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are separate. But that can't be right because the problem includes both parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. That seems to make sense. Therefore, I think the answer is 384.\n\nBut let me confirm by another method. Let's compute the entire expression. \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15c^{-2} + 6c^{-4} + c^{-6}\\). Now, when we multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(120a^2b^2\\), \\(90a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 + 36 = 42, 42 + 90 = 132, 132 + 120 = 252, 252 + 90 = 342, 342 + 36 = 378, 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n\nWait, but in this computation, I'm considering all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\) is 384. Therefore, the answer is 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had asked for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), then it would still be 120 because that's the term where \\(c^0\\) is present. But since the problem doesn't specify \\(c\\), it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which is 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the binomial expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6.\n2. The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(64\\).\n3. Multiply these results: \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms? Or do I need to consider their contribution somehow? Hmm, let me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the entire expression is a product of two expansions, I think I need to consider all possible ways that when multiplied together, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes from the first part, and the second part can contribute any term, but since the problem is only about \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is a product, so when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only comes from the first part, right? Because the second part is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it because they are variables different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but no, actually, the entire product is a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. But wait, that doesn't seem right because each term in the second expansion has different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all those multiplications. Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the product, each term is a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so it's actually the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion. But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion has terms with different powers of \\(c\\), so when you multiply, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of those terms, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient, and when multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, they all add up to the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, I think that's the case. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion? The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and when multiplied by each term in the second expansion, it's like distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the second expansion. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. So, yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each term in the product is a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the term in the second expansion when multiplied by it, but since the second expansion has multiple terms, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but another thought: is that correct? Because in reality, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in the first polynomial, so when you multiply by the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, which are all terms with different powers of \\(c\\). Therefore, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second expansion, but since each of those terms has different exponents of \\(c\\), they don't interfere with each other in terms of combining like terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nSo, to confirm, the coefficient from the first part is 6, and the sum of coefficients from the second part is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and \\((c + 1/c)\\) is just \\(c + 1/c\\). So, multiplying them together, we get \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be 1 (from \\(a^2\\)) multiplied by (1 + 1) = 2, so 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 multiplied by 2, which is 4, and the coefficient of \\(b^2\\) would be 1 multiplied by 2, which is 2. So, in this case, the coefficients of \\(a^2\\), \\(ab\\), and \\(b^2\\) are each multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second expansion, which is 2. So, that seems to confirm my earlier logic. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you distribute, each term in the second polynomial multiplies the entire first polynomial, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of coefficients from the second part. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is a single term, and when you multiply by the second polynomial, it's like scaling that term by each coefficient in the second polynomial, and then adding them all up. So, the total coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part. \n\nTherefore, I think I can confidently say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), resulting in \\(2^6 = 64\\).

So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, that doesn't seem right either because each term in the second expansion has its own coefficient. Wait, no, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only affected by the constant term in the second expansion because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the constant term in the second part. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be done using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. Since we're looking for the term that only has \\(a^2b^2\\) and no \\(c\\) terms, we multiply the coefficients from each part. So, 6 * 20 = 120. That makes sense. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the product of these two expansions. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I might not need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, maybe the \\(c\\) terms will just multiply the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, actually, that's not quite right because the entire expression is a product. So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term's coefficient will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. So, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, but that seems confusing because the second part is a separate expansion. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no, actually, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, when multiplied by any term in the second part, it will result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) across all \\(k\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present when multiplied by terms that don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), which is only possible if we take the term from the second expansion that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because otherwise, multiplying by \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\) would introduce \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. That makes sense now. So, I need to compute two things: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Then, multiply them together to get the final coefficient. \n\nI already found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) to be 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that doesn't seem right because 6! is 720, and 3! is 6, so 720 divided by (6 * 6) is 20, which is correct. So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. \n\nNow, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to multiply the coefficients from each part. So, that's 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). Let me compute that: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 120. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I expanded \\((a + b)^4\\) and found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) to be 6. Then, I expanded \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and found the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) to be 20. Multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of it as the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will only come from the product of \\(a^2b^2\\) and the constant term from the second expansion, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I'm confident that the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I also need to consider this part because the entire expression is a product of these two. But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, when I multiply the two expressions together, the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) will affect the coefficients of the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I need to consider how the coefficients from the second part will combine with the coefficients from the first part. \n\nWait, but actually, since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part? Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will just be multiplied by every term in the second part, right? So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), but since we're only interested in the terms that don't involve \\(c\\), wait, no, actually, no. Wait, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you expand this, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the coefficient a sum over all possible terms, but actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to that term. But in this case, since the first polynomial is in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second is in \\(c\\), the exponents in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are independent of those in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because every term in the second part, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), would contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. \n\nSo, to clarify, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\(\\left(1 + 1/1\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\nWait, but hold on, let me double-check that. Because actually, when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that term. But in this case, since the variables are different (\\(a, b\\) vs \\(c, 1/c\\)), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial and multiply it by every term from the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. So, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the entire product being \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire expansion of the second part. But since the second part is multiplied by the first part, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, so 6*64=384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me consider a simpler case. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{0} = 1\\) times \\((1 + 1)\\), which is 2. So, the coefficient would be 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^1\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{2}{1} = 2\\) times the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is 2, so 4. And the coefficient of \\(a^0b^2\\) would be 1 times 2, which is 2. So, that seems to check out. Therefore, in the given problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of coefficients in the second part because each term in the second part is multiplied by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Therefore, yes, 6 times 64 is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's the same as taking the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiplying it by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would result in the coefficient being 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should also compute the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) to confirm the sum of coefficients. So, let's do that. Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The sum of the coefficients is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\), which matches what I thought earlier. So, the sum of coefficients in the second part is indeed 64.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me just think again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in the first part, and \\(c\\) is in the second, the variables are independent. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) come from the first part, and the exponents of \\(c\\) come from the second. Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part multiplied by any term in the second part, because the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to see this is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, and when you multiply it by the entire second polynomial, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product becomes 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of it as the product of two polynomials. Let me denote P = (a + b)^4 and Q = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product P * Q will have terms like (term from P) * (term from Q). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) can only come from the term in P that is \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6a^2b^2, multiplied by each term in Q. But since Q is in terms of c, each term in Q is a coefficient times some power of c. Therefore, in the product P * Q, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will have a coefficient equal to 6 multiplied by each coefficient in Q, but since we're considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of c, it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Q, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by Q evaluated at c = 1, because when you set c = 1, you get the sum of all coefficients in Q. Therefore, Q at c = 1 is 2^6 = 64, so the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me also consider that maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the variables are independent, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P and the sum of coefficients in Q. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as \\((a + b)^4 \\times (c + 1/c)^6\\), and since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are independent variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the coefficient of any term in \\((c + 1/c)^6\\), but since we're considering the entire expression, it's just the product of the two coefficients. Wait, no, that's not quite right. It's more accurate to say that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P times the sum of all coefficients in Q because each term in Q is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).\n\nWait, perhaps an example would help. Let's take P = (a + b)^1 = a + b, and Q = (c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c. Then, P * Q = (a + b)(c + 1/c) = a c + a/c + b c + b/c. Now, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is c + 1/c, which when evaluated at c=1 is 2. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(a^0b^1\\) is also c + 1/c, which is 2 when c=1. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^1b^0\\) is the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients from Q, which is 1 * 2 = 2. Similarly, for \\(a^0b^1\\), it's also 1 * 2 = 2. So, this seems to confirm that the coefficient of any \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) in P * Q is the coefficient from P times the sum of coefficients from Q.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me also compute it another way to make sure. Let's compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiply it by the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nFirst, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6.\n\nNow, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The sum of the coefficients here is 1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nNow, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(6a^2b^2 \\times (c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6)\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times each coefficient in the second expansion, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply \\(6a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(36a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). So, in the product, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, \\(a^2b^2c^4\\) is 36, \\(a^2b^2c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, \\(a^2b^2/c^2\\) is 90, \\(a^2b^2/c^4\\) is 36, and \\(a^2b^2/c^6\\) is 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 + 36 + 90 + 120 + 90 + 36 + 6. Let me compute that: 6 + 36 = 42; 42 + 90 = 132; 132 + 120 = 252; 252 + 90 = 342; 342 + 36 = 378; 378 + 6 = 384. So, that confirms it: the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 384.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and checks, I'm confident that the coefficient is 384.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem and properties of polynomial multiplication.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   Thus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The sum of all coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Since the two expressions are multiplied together, every term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem only asks for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I need to find all the terms in the second expression \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), don't introduce any additional \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. In other words, I need the constant term with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but since the second expression only involves \\(c\\), I think it's actually independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the entire coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term is multiplied by each term of the other polynomial. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are in one polynomial and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are in the other, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part by any term from the second part. But the second part doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so all those terms will just be multiplied by constants. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first polynomial is 6, and when multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, it will create terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc., depending on the expansion of the second polynomial. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in the product would have terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, but the exponent of \\(c\\) can be anything. Wait, but the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That means I need to consider all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and then sum the coefficients of those terms. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the terms are combined by adding their coefficients if they have the same variables with the same exponents. So, in this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial will be multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, which is in terms of \\(c\\). So, the product will have terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), \\(a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), etc., each with their own coefficients. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which in this case would be the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) are zero, i.e., the constant term. So, to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) that is a constant (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and that will give me the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", but in the product \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by all the terms from the second polynomial. So, actually, \\(a^2b^2\\) will have coefficients multiplied by each term in the second polynomial, leading to terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean summing all the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\). But that doesn't make much sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a single term, and in the product, it's multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), making it a different term each time. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, no, that's not correct either because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. But the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will appear multiplied by each term from the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since the second polynomial is a polynomial in \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the entire second polynomial. So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). That is, all terms where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is raised to any power. So, in that case, the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, not a single number. So, that can't be right either.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second polynomial. The sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Let me think differently. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the expression is a product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\), then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct because I might be misapplying the concept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not specified. So, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because coefficients are scalars. Therefore, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of the second polynomial. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is not a single number. Therefore, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, first, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. Let me check this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the constant term is when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\), and the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, when you multiply the two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part, resulting in \\(6 * 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."
