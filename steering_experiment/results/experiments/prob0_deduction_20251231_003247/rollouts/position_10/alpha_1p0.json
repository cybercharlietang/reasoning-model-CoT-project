    "text": " The coefficient here would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. But wait, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I also need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But how does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the other part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest of the expression doesn't change that because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). Wait, but when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second. So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? That doesn't sound right because the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, perhaps the \\(c\\) terms are just along for the ride, and when we look for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we just consider the part from \\((a + b)^4\\) and ignore the \\(c\\) part because it doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so technically, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expression, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, maybe the \\(c\\) part can be considered separately, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of the \\(c\\) terms, but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient would then be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it would produce terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the other terms are multiplied by \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check this again. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) becomes \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps we're only considering the part of the expansion that has \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient would be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms would just be multiplied by that, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps it's just 6. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficient would actually involve the sum over all possible ways to get \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by any term from the second expression. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term from the second expression would just multiply it by a coefficient. So, the total coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems more accurate. Let me verify this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by 64, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the other part doesn't affect that. But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the part with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so the coefficient is just 6. But I'm not sure. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which includes all terms, so that would be 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) equal to 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to have the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) as 6, and the rest is just part of the expression that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that \\(c\\) terms cancel out, but that's not specified. Wait, the problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so perhaps it's considering the entire expression, and the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is simply 6, because the problem is only asking about the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. But I'm not sure. Let me try to see. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from the second polynomial, it would be \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some term involving \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps it's considering the entire product, and the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second polynomial, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6, and the rest is just part of the expression. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning that the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, but that's not specified. So, perhaps the answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, I think I need to clarify this. Let me think about it differently. Suppose I expand \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) separately. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(4a^3b\\), \\(6a^2b^2\\), \\(4ab^3\\), and \\(b^4\\). The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^5\\), \\(15c^4\\), \\(20c^3\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(6c\\), and \\(c^0 = 1\\), etc. So, when you multiply these two expansions together, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^5\\), etc. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^6\\) is 6, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^5\\) is 6, and so on, up to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) being 6. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponents, which would mean adding up all the coefficients where the term is \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, meaning that the \\(c\\) terms are ignored, which would be 6. But I'm not sure. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without mentioning \\(c\\). So, perhaps the answer is 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate and don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and that's it. But I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by the entire other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, which would be 6, and the \\(c\\) terms are just part of the expression but don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that's the correct approach. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one is multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the other. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * (sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)). The sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the entire expression:**\n   The given expression is a product of two polynomials: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n3. **Sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the total contribution of the second polynomial to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we calculate the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). This is done by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficient from the first polynomial and the sum of coefficients from the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

So, I think I need to consider the entire product. However, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are different variables, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). That is, when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms will be independent. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe it's just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when we multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial gets multiplied by each term in the second. However, since we're only looking for terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, the other part of the product (the part with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\)) doesn't affect the exponent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the sum of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but the entire expression also includes \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but how do I find the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\)? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64, so when we multiply, the coefficient becomes 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) and the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the terms in each polynomial that multiply together to give that term. So, in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first polynomial, and the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because each term in the second polynomial is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think about it differently. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^4 = A\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = B\\). Then, the product \\(A \\times B\\) will have terms where each term in \\(A\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(B\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) will be multiplied by every term in \\(B\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(A \\times B\\) will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(A\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), because each term in \\(B\\) contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in \\(B\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), as I did before. So, \\(B\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in \\(B\\) is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that this is correct. Let me take a simpler example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^0\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in \\((a + b)^2\\), which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in \\((c + 1/c)^1\\), which is \\((1 + 1) = 2\\). So, the coefficient would be 1 * 2 = 2. Let me check by expanding: \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). \\((c + 1/c)^1 = c + 1/c\\). So, the product is \\(a^2(c + 1/c) + 2ab(c + 1/c) + b^2(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product is \\(c + 1/c\\), which is 2 when \\(c = 1\\). So, yes, that works. Similarly, the coefficient of \\(ab\\) would be 2 * (c + 1/c), which is 4. \n\nWait, but in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the original problem is 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two polynomials and use generating functions. The generating function for \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\( (a + b)^4 \\), and for \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\( \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 \\). When you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial and the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, as the second polynomial doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). \n\nSo, yes, I think 384 is the correct answer. \n\nWait, just to make sure, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and see what the sum of coefficients is. As I did before, setting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n$\\boxed{384}$"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the term we're interested in is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient from the second part is just 1? Because when you multiply by 1, it doesn't change the coefficient. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, because when you multiply two terms, one from each expansion, the exponents add up. So, to get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), we need the term from the first expansion with \\(a^2b^2\\) and the term from the second expansion with \\(c^0\\), since \\(c^0 = 1\\), which doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying that, each term becomes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} c^{-m} = \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which implies \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). So, the coefficient from the second part is 20. Now, since the two parts are multiplied together, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the second part). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me double-check that. So, in \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being the product of two expansions, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by expanding each part separately. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) for the \\(c^0\\) term is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, I need to consider that as well. But hold on, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), when I multiply it by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it will just be \\(6 a^2b^2\\) times the entire expansion, but the question is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms are involved in the product, but maybe not. Wait, no, the expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them together, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in \\((a + b)^4\\), then when I multiply by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that's not correct because we're looking for a specific term, not the entire product. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then it would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term contributes a coefficient, and the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all possible powers of \\(c\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, that might make sense. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but that's not the case because the expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the terms in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but since the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, it would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have two polynomials multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b)\\) and \\(Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\(P(a, b) \\cdot Q(c)\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) multiplied by the entire polynomial \\(Q(c)\\), because when you multiply, each term in \\(P\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(Q\\). But if the question is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then it would be the coefficient from \\(P(a, b)\\) times the sum of the coefficients in \\(Q(c)\\), which is \\(Q(1)\\). So, in this case, \\(Q(c) = \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so \\(Q(1) = (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would include terms multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. So, perhaps the correct approach is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest of the expression is irrelevant because it's multiplied by terms that don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) coefficients. But that doesn't seem right because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would be multiplied. \n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as two separate expansions. The first part is \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^4\\), ..., \\(1/c^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from \\(a^2b^2\\)) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is indeed \\(2^6 = 64\\), because when you set \\(c = 1\\), you get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and the rest is a distraction. But that seems unlikely because the problem includes both parts. So, I think the correct approach is that the coefficient is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but let me think differently. Suppose I expand both parts separately and then multiply. The first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), has terms up to \\(a^4b^0\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), has terms from \\(c^6\\) down to \\(1/c^6\\). When you multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is multiplied by all terms in the other polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that doesn't make sense because we're looking for a specific coefficient, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nSo, after all that, I think the coefficient is 384. Let me just check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\n2. The second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms from \\(c^6\\) to \\(1/c^6\\). \n\n3. When multiplying the two expansions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. \n\n4. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. \n\n5. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. \n\n6. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). \n\n7. So, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   \\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 64 = 384\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{384}\\)."

I need to consider how this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\).

So, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the problem might be implying that the entire term is \\(a^2b^2\\), but since it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which includes terms with \\(c\\), maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. That is, treat the entire expression as a product, and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But that seems odd because usually, when you're asked for the coefficient of a specific term, you have to consider all the other variables as well.

But that can't be right because the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 would be 384, but that seems too large, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting just the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is 6 times something, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's possible that the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6, because the \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) part doesn't affect the coefficients of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that seems too simple. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have some power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product. That makes more sense. So, I need to consider both expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and find the coefficient where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, let's break it down. First, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. Because when I multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by \\(c^0\\), that's the term we're interested in. So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). To find the constant term, I can use the binomial expansion again. The general term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6*6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Now, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. So, when you multiply these two parts, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by all the terms from the second part. But since we're only interested in the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, that's where we take the constant term. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. That seems correct. Let me check my steps again. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly using the binomial coefficient, which is 6. Then, I considered that the problem might be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), but realized that without considering \\(c\\), it's just 6, but that seems too simple. Then, I reconsidered and thought that perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would make sense, so I proceeded to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120. So, I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20.

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only present in \\((a + b)^4\\), and when multiplied by any term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), it just scales the coefficient. So, the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expression. Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). In that case, the coefficient would just be 6, because the other part of the product doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that might make more sense. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial doesn't depend on the other polynomial's terms unless you're looking for a combined term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is indeed 64, as I calculated before. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), so it's just 6, because the other part is multiplied by all the \\(c\\) terms, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient would remain 6. Wait, that makes sense too. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression is multiplied by each term in the second, but if you're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then all the terms from the second expression just scale the coefficient. So, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. But wait, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then the second expression becomes 64, as I thought before, so the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that it's just 6, because the \\(c\\) terms are separate. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product. But in the product, each term will have powers of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be multiplied by any term from the second expression, meaning that the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression's expansion. But that seems odd because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not an expression. So, perhaps I need to consider that the coefficient is just 6, because the other part is multiplied by \\(c\\) terms, which are separate variables, so they don't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as a separate variable and thus the coefficient remains 6. Let me think again. If I have two expressions multiplied together, say \\(P(a, b) \\times Q(c)\\), then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\(P(a, b)\\) times the entire \\(Q(c)\\) expression. But since \\(Q(c)\\) is a separate polynomial, the coefficient would just be 6 times \\(Q(c)\\). But that doesn't make sense because \\(Q(c)\\) isn't a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that it's just 6. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(Q(c)\\), which would be the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). So, perhaps I should compute the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. Let me try that. To find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) times 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Hmm, that seems more plausible. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 384. Instead, I should only consider the constant term from the second expression because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which is the term we're interested in. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Let me verify this again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\) with coefficient 6. Then, in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is 20. So, when you multiply these two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) gets multiplied by 20, giving a coefficient of 120. That makes sense because if you set \\(c = 1\\), the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 64\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be 6 * 64 = 384 if we consider all terms. But wait, that's a different approach. So, which one is correct? I think the key is whether the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), or if it's asking for the coefficient when considering all variables. If it's the former, then it's 6 * 20 = 120. If it's the latter, then it's 6 * 64 = 384. But the problem states: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the product, each term will have some combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expression, meaning that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be 6 times the entire second expression. But that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be 6 times the entire second polynomial. But that can't be right because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Therefore, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), meaning that we're treating the entire second expression as a scalar. But that's not accurate because the second expression is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be 6 times the entire polynomial. However, that seems contradictory because the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just a multiplier, so the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second part. But that would mean 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just 6. But that seems inconsistent because the product would have terms with \\(c\\) involved.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. When you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in one polynomial is the same as its coefficient in the original polynomial, because the other polynomial's terms just multiply each term. So, in this case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) polynomial. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product, and that term would have coefficients multiplied by the terms from the second polynomial. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a scalar. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting me to treat \\(c\\) as another variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider that the entire expression is a product, and the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I think I was correct earlier when I considered that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the constant term of the second polynomial. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get a term with \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms would involve \\(c\\) to some power, which would make them different terms. So, if I'm only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant, so the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion is a product of a term from the first polynomial and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering all possible terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. The sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 120 when considering only the constant term. Now I'm confused. Let me try to clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for various \\(k\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term without any \\(c\\) factors. Therefore, the only term that contributes to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) is when the second polynomial contributes a constant term, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if I'm looking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then I need to consider only the term where the second polynomial contributes a constant, so that the resulting term is \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nLet me double-check this. The expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives terms with various powers of \\(c\\). The constant term is 20, as I calculated before. Therefore, when multiplying, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by 20, giving \\(120a^2b^2\\). All other terms from the second polynomial would result in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), which are different from \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 120.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is just part of the first part, and when multiplied by the second part, it might combine with terms from there. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Hmm, so maybe I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms because they don't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let me think. When you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the second part is raised to the 6th power and involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right either. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term in the second expansion has coefficients, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is just a single term, the overall coefficient would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, but that's not correct because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, actually, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term would be \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{something}\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because each term in the second part is separate. Let me think again. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the second part is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which when expanded, has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15/c^2\\), \\(6/c^4\\), and \\(1/c^6\\). Each of these terms is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\). So, when we multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of these, we get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, i.e., the constant term. So, in the second part, the constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let me calculate that. In \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\times (1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the constant term from the second part (which is 20). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, but let me double-check that. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part with coefficient 6, and the constant term from the second part is 20, so when you multiply them together, you get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Hmm, that seems right. Let me confirm by expanding both parts. First, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives \\(a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. Now, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) expands to \\(c^6 + 6c^4 + 15c^2 + 20 + 15/c^2 + 6/c^4 + 1/c^6\\). The constant term is 20. So, when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, but the only term that doesn't involve \\(c\\) is the constant term 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I got it right.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Thus, the coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

So, in other words, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me compute that.

So, if we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that would mean we need to collect all the terms where the exponents of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) multiply to give \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the term would have a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) component, and thus not just \\(a^2b^2\\). So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and then multiply that by the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\), which is 6. Let me check that logic. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But to get a term that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's compute that. Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) in each term is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 multiplied by 20, which is 120. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) for \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them together gives 6 * 20 = 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 120. I think that makes sense. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire product as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where the \\(c\\) terms cancel out. So, yeah, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by multiplying the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. From \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n2. From \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n3. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. \n\nBut wait, the original expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider the entire expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second factor, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), their coefficients won't be affected by that part. So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6? Hmm, maybe. Let me think again. \n\nWait, no. Actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), the terms from the second factor will multiply the terms from the first factor. However, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the only way it can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that is \\(c^0\\), which is 1, because any term with \\(c\\) raised to a power would change the term. So, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when that term is multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it will contribute to the overall coefficient. \n\nWait, so perhaps I was too quick to say that the coefficient is just 6. Maybe I need to consider the product. Let me structure this properly. The entire expression is the product of two expansions: one in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in terms of \\(c\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), their coefficients are independent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nSo, I already found that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me expand that using the binomial theorem as well. \n\nThe expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k\\). Simplifying each term, that becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} c^{-k} = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). \n\nWe need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. So, set \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\), we get \\(6 = 2k\\) which means \\(k = 3\\). \n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20. \n\nNow, going back to the original expression, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the other factor is 20. Since these two terms are multiplied together in the product, the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me verify that. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) gives us 20 for \\(c^0\\). When we multiply these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since we only care about the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which is 20, then the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. Since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), it only gets multiplied by the constant term (in terms of \\(c\\)) from the second polynomial. So, that's why we multiply 6 by 20. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the binomial coefficients. For \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), yes, that's 6. And for \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), that's 20. So, 6 * 20 is 120. \n\nAlternatively, if I think about the entire expression, when you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) that affects it is the constant term, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120 is indeed the correct coefficient. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nWe need the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2.

The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be the coefficient from the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of each term in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion would be when we set \\(c = 1\\). Because substituting \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) gives the sum of all coefficients. So, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check. If I have two expansions, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I multiply them together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Because each term in the second expansion contributes its own coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64, so the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nBut wait, another way to think about it is that when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the specific term we're looking for is \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\). So, any term in the second expansion will have some power of \\(c\\), but since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that seems contradictory because the second expansion is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're essentially distributing \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm this by another method. Let's consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). We can write this as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + c^{-1}\\right)^6\\). Now, when we multiply these two, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + c^{-1}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + c^{-1}\\right)^6\\), which is a sum of terms like \\(c^k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from -6 to 6 in steps of 2. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is indeed 64. Therefore, 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is unaffected by the \\(c\\) terms, so it's just the product of the coefficients from each part. Since the first part contributes 6 and the second part contributes 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Suppose I have two polynomials, P(a, b) and Q(c). Then, the coefficient of a specific term in P(a, b) is independent of Q(c), except that when you multiply, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in P(a, b), then in the product P(a, b) * Q(c), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in Q(c), resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), we have to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire Q(c). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P(a, b) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q(c). Because when you distribute, each term in Q(c) adds a multiple of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the coefficients add up. So, yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but that's not exactly right because the second part is a separate variable. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be 6 times the entire expansion of the second part. But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me clarify: the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) and the other in \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, not a number. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient in the entire product, treating all variables as separate. But actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), so when you multiply by the second part, each term in the second part will multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2c^{-k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expression. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expression, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (each term in the second expression), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the sum of all the coefficients in the second expression, multiplied by 6. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, I need to compute 6 times the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, in this case, set \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. Wait, but let me double-check that. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of it as the product of the two coefficients: the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) for \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the coefficient from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 64 when considering all terms. So, multiplying them together gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). To find the sum of the coefficients in the second part, substitute \\(c = 1\\), yielding \\(2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I have to consider the entire expression. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means, regardless of what happens with the \\(c\\) terms, I just need the part that comes from \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6, and then I have to multiply it by whatever comes from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\), the other part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is just a constant multiplier for that term. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, if I have \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that means, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), it's multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right. Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term with some power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each of those terms, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, right? Wait, no, actually, I think I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, that would mean that in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is of the form coefficient times \\(c^k\\), and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times coefficient times \\(c^k\\). So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then it's the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), multiplied by 6. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) include terms with positive and negative exponents, but when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), you're just scaling it by those coefficients. However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) multiplied by 6. But actually, no, that's not correct because each term in the product will have a specific power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), each coefficient from the second expansion gets multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion times 6. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again. So, \\((a + b)^4\\) gives us terms like \\(a^4, 4a^3b, 6a^2b^2, 4ab^3, b^4\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well, giving terms like \\(c^6, 6c^4, 15c^2, 20, 15\\dfrac{1}{c^2}, 6\\dfrac{1}{c^4}, \\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). The sum of the coefficients is indeed 64 because when \\(c = 1\\), each term becomes its coefficient, so \\(1 + 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 64\\). So, when we multiply the two expansions together, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6, 6a^2b^2c^4, 6a^2b^2c^2, 6a^2b^2, 6a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^2}, 6a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^4}, 6a^2b^2\\dfrac{1}{c^6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by 6. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 384. Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms from each polynomial. But in this case, we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, every term in the second expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, but wait, another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and since we're multiplying by the entire second expression, which has a sum of coefficients equal to 64, the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, if we consider that \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when we multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all k from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}\\) from k=0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64. So, 6 * 64 = 384. So, yeah, that confirms it. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{384}\\)"

But wait, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that mean I have to multiply this 6 by something from the second part? Hmm, no, because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. Wait, but the entire expression is a product of two binomials, so maybe I have to consider how they multiply. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. But in this case, the first part is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't appear in the second part, and \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) don't appear in the first part. So, actually, the variables are separate. That is, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), and the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, when you multiply them together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part would be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect that coefficient. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would mean we have to consider how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears in the product. But wait, no, because each term in the product will be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or something like that. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would actually be the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) because when you multiply by the other terms, they don't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be 6, the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\), because the other part doesn't contribute any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Let's think about it differently. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. So, for example, a term might be \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^3\\), or \\(a^3b \\times c^2\\), etc. But the problem is asking specifically for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need to find all the terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 and 2, respectively. But in the first expansion, \\((a + b)^4\\), the only term with \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6\\(a^2b^2\\). In the second expansion, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term is of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, when you multiply 6\\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get terms like 6\\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that would only happen if the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, because \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, we need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Let's solve for \\(k\\) in \\(6 - 2k = 0\\). So, \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) implies \\(2k = 6\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(k = 3\\) in the second expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{6 - 2 \\times 3} = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). So, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). Therefore, the term in the second expansion that contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 20. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 (from the first expansion) multiplied by 20 (from the second expansion), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Wait, so that's different from what I thought earlier. Initially, I thought it was just 6, but now I see that it's actually 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. So, that makes sense because when you multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term (c^0) from the second part, which is 20. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Let me double-check this reasoning. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is 20. Therefore, when multiplying the two expressions, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. That seems correct. Alternatively, I could think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables don't interfere. So, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion where the variables don't affect each other. So, that would be 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. To find the coefficient in the entire expression, we also need the constant term (coefficient of \\(c^0\\)) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

But actually, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term in the product of the two expansions.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem is likely expecting a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that still doesn't give a single number. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\), specifically, 6 times the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that seems too involved, and the problem might be expecting a numerical coefficient, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Let me check that possibility. So, if I need the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then I have to find the term in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). So, from \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need the coefficient of \\(c^0\\), which is the constant term. So, let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

The coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 20, correct. So, multiplying these together gives 6 * 20 = 120. That seems right.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient when considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because when you multiply by 6, it's like scaling the entire second expansion. But in reality, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. Hmm, but the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, does that mean the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384? Wait, that seems high. Let me check that again. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is simply the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part. But the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply 6 by that, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times each term in the second expansion. But the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, no, actually, in the product, each term is a product of terms from both expansions. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, and it's multiplied by every term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not. It's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Wait, that can't be. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, perhaps the problem is to treat \\(c\\) as a variable and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms with \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, not a polynomial. So, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. That would make more sense because then the coefficient would be a number. Alternatively, maybe it's to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), but that would be a polynomial, not a single number. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. As I thought earlier, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 * 64 = 384. But let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible \\(c\\) terms, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense. So, I think the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), summed over all possible \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), which is 1. In that case, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and then multiply it by 6. So, let's compute that. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120. But wait, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), it just said \\(a^2b^2\\). So, which interpretation is correct? If it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But that seems too large, and usually, such problems ask for a specific term, like \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is to consider the product as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\), and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. In that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me think again. Wait, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in the factors. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first factor, and it's multiplied by every term in the second factor. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first factor times the entire second factor. But the second factor is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient, so perhaps it's only considering the constant term, i.e., the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). Therefore, I think the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let's do that. From the first factor, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. From the second factor, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\), as I calculated earlier. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but let me confirm. Alternatively, if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without considering \\(c\\), then it's 6 times the entire second expansion, which would be 6 * 64 = 384. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the problem wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term containing \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this part is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second factor \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion because we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The exponent of \\(c\\) is 0 when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Okay, so that's the first part.\n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the coefficient of whatever term in the second part that doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, right? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply the entire second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the entire second part is being multiplied by the first part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would just be 6 times \\(2^6\\) because each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is either \\(c^k\\) or \\(c^{-k}\\), but when you expand it, the sum of all coefficients is when you set \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Wait, but that seems too high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, that approach might not be correct because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a specific term, not the entire expansion. But in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second. So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, which is not possible because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are only in the first part, and \\(c\\) is only in the second part, when we multiply the two expressions, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean 6 times the sum of coefficients, which, as I thought before, is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems too large. Wait, but actually, when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply term by term, but in this case, the first polynomial only has terms with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the second has terms with \\(c\\). So, when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part will multiply every term in the second part, each contributing a coefficient. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is indeed 6 times the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is 384. Therefore, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when variables are involved, you might have to consider cross terms, but in this case, since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are all separate variables, their exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is indeed 6 times 64, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each term in the product being a combination of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion is 6, and since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), all the terms in the second expansion will just multiply the 6, giving 6 times each term in the second expansion. But since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nWait, but maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider the entire product. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When we expand this, each term will be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^{k} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m\\). Simplifying the second part, that's \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the entire term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^{k}c^{6 - 2m}\\).\n\nNow, we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the term \\(a^{4 - k}b^{k}\\), we need \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, \\(k = 2\\), which gives us \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Now, for the \\(c\\) part, \\(c^{6 - 2m}\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) part can be anything because it's multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times the sum over all \\(m\\) of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\). Because each term in the second expansion contributes \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the coefficient, and since we're multiplying by 6, the total coefficient is 6 times the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\).\n\nBut the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from \\(m = 0\\) to \\(6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, 6 times 64 is indeed 384. So, that confirms it.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a possibility that when multiplying, some terms might affect the \\(a^2b^2\\) term? For example, if there were variables overlapping, but in this case, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are distinct, so each term in the product will have a part from the first expansion and a part from the second, but since they don't share variables, the exponents don't interfere. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is 6 times 64, so 384.\n\nSo, after going through this step by step, I think the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(2^6 = 64\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are variables separate from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), when we multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with those involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

But that seems too complicated. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). So, when I expand the entire expression, I need to find all terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is present, multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe it's just 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, which would include all possible combinations of \\(c\\) terms. But actually, the way the problem is phrased, it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might mean that it's considering \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and perhaps \\(c\\) terms are being treated separately. Wait, but in the product, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like a huge number. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but without considering the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient would just be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), not a single number. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would then have coefficients that are expressions in \\(c\\). But that seems unlikely because the problem is phrased as \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", which probably refers to the coefficient without considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and only find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\). But that still doesn't quite make sense because \\(c\\) is a variable. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, which would involve all the terms from both expansions. But that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too large, and I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-express the problem: We have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). We need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is equal to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is usually a number. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but it's not stated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to treat \\(c\\) as a constant and only consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which would involve summing over all possible terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of \\(c\\). But that seems like it would require more information. Wait, perhaps the problem is actually to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem says \"the coefficient\", implying a single number, so perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, considering all possible terms, but that would require knowing which term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is being multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, no, because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, resulting in \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems like the coefficient is a polynomial, not a single number. Hmm, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, but only considering the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). That is, the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because then we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, let me try that approach. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. Each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(1/c\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We need the exponent of \\(c\\) to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient is 6.\n\n2. **Find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."
