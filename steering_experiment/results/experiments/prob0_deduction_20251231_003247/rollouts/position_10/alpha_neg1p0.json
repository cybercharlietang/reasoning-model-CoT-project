    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I think that the terms in \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) are multiplied together, but since the variables involved are different (a, b, c), the coefficients will multiply as well. Wait, no, actually, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is a term involving a and b, and each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a term involving c and 1/c. So, when I multiply them together, the terms will involve products of a, b, c, and 1/c. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That suggests that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) could be multiplied by different powers of c and 1/c, but since the problem doesn't specify any condition on c, maybe it just wants the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms. Alternatively, perhaps the c terms are being handled separately, and since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe we can treat the c part as a separate expansion and just take the coefficient from the a and b part and multiply by the sum of the coefficients from the c part? Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the entire expression is a product of two separate expansions. So, when I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), I get terms involving a and b, and when I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get terms involving c and 1/c. When I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that right? Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those will contribute to different terms in the final product. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the c terms, maybe we're supposed to consider that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, without considering c. But that doesn't make much sense because c is part of the expression. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but it's not specified. Wait, the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", so maybe it's considering the entire product, and any terms involving c. But that would mean that \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which would be the sum of the coefficients of each term in that expansion. \n\nWait, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by setting c = 1. So, substituting c = 1, we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is 64. So, then, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would mean that we're considering the product of the two expansions, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second expansion, so the coefficient would indeed be 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion of the entire expression, but considering that the variables are a, b, and c. So, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of c. So, that would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me consider the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). So, each of these terms would contribute to the overall product. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is when c = 1, which is 2^6 = 64, then the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but that seems correct, but let me verify it another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. The first polynomial is \\((a + b)^4\\) and the second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial is 6, as we found. The second polynomial, when expanded, has various terms, each with their own coefficients. When we multiply the two polynomials, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second polynomial. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, as calculated by substituting c = 1, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the term \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, but that's not possible because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second polynomial, you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. So, unless the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be the sum of all those coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, considering that the c terms are separate. So, perhaps the answer is just 6, but that doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes the c terms, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the c expansion.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and the question is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that we're considering the entire product, and the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by all possible terms from the c expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of coefficients from the second part.\n\nWait, but let me think about it in another way. Let me consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, then the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, as we found. Now, when I multiply by the second expansion, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by each of the coefficients in the second expansion, and then summed together. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each term from the second expansion has its own coefficient, so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term, the coefficient for each of those terms would be 6 times the coefficient from the second expansion. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion. Since the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 64, as we found earlier, then the total coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider that the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But that would only be the case if we're looking for a term that's a product of a^2b^2 and some term from the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any c terms. That doesn't make sense because the entire expression includes c terms, so \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by various c terms. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion, which is 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be interpreted differently. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where the exponents of a and b are 2 and 2, and the exponent of c is 0. In that case, we would need to find the term in the second expansion where the exponent of c is 0, which is the constant term. So, let's see. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) can be found using the binomial theorem as well. The general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent of c to be 0, so 6 - 2k = 0, which gives k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), i.e., the term where a and b are squared and c is to the zero power. In that case, the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem just says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\", without specifying c. So, maybe the problem is ambiguous. But in the context of the problem, perhaps it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 384. Alternatively, if it's intended to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the problem again. It says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, it's just asking for \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of c. That suggests that we are to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any power of c, so the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some k, but since it's not specified, maybe it's just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, leading to 384.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the constant term, I got 120, which is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, perhaps the problem is intended to be that, but without specifying c, maybe it's just 120. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in a and b, and the other in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply them, the terms will be products of terms from each polynomial. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first polynomial will be multiplied by each term from the second polynomial, each of which has a coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the sum of all those products. That is, 6 times each coefficient from the second polynomial, which would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. Since the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial is 64, the total coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second polynomial, which is 20, leading to 120.\n\nWait, but I think that the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, so that would be 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to verify with an example. Suppose we have a simpler case: \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Then, expanding this, we get \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2) \\times (c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 0 because in the first expansion, the highest power of a and b is 2, and in the second expansion, we have c and 1/c. So, when multiplied, the terms would be \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2ab c\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is 0. Hmm, that's different. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0 because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying a term from the first expansion by a term from the second expansion, since the second expansion only has terms with c and 1/c, not a and b.\n\nWait, so in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 0, which makes sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would require multiplying two terms from the first expansion, but since we're only multiplying each term from the first expansion by each term from the second expansion, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by itself. So, in the original problem, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving c terms.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier reasoning. So, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the problem, the expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). When expanding, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, for example, \\(a^4\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(6a^4c^4\\), etc. Similarly, \\(a^3b\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^3bc^6\\), \\(6a^3bc^4\\), etc. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, giving \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^2\\), \\(20a^2b^2\\), \\(15a^2b^2c^{-2}\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^{-4}\\), and \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). So, in the entire product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present with a coefficient of 20, as that's the constant term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product. Wait, but in that case, the first expansion is \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\), and the second expansion is \\(c + 1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, you get terms like \\(a^2c\\), \\(a^2/c\\), \\(2abc\\), \\(2ab/c\\), \\(b^2c\\), \\(b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because you can't multiply two terms from the first expansion to get \\(a^2b^2\\) while also multiplying by terms from the second expansion. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed zero.\n\nBut in the original problem, \\((a + b)^4\\) has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) which is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is present in the product with various coefficients depending on the c terms. But if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms, that is, \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the c terms, then it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But in the example I considered, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because there was no way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving c terms. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without also having some power of c.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because in the product, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the constant term \\(c^0\\), which gives \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the product, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists with coefficient 120, as we found earlier. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120, because that's the term where c is raised to the zero power. If the problem is asking for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384, but if it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it's 120.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is written as \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all terms where a is squared, b is squared, and c is raised to any power. So, that would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because you can't have \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving c terms, but in the original problem, you can have \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is \\(a^2b^2\\), so the coefficient is 120. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. Alternatively, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of c, then it's 384. But given that the problem includes c terms, perhaps it's more likely that it's asking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, to resolve this, perhaps I should consider the entire product and see what the term \\(a^2b^2\\) looks like. In the product, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by substituting c = 1, which gives \\( (1 + 1)^6 = 64 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nBut then, in the example I did earlier, with \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 2 = 12, but in reality, when you expand it, you get no \\(a^2b^2\\) term because the second expansion only has c and 1/c. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the example, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)\\) expands to \\(a^2c + a^2/c + 2abc + 2ab/c + b^2c + b^2/c\\). There is no \\(a^2b^2\\) term, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, my earlier approach must be wrong. So, perhaps the correct way is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) by multiplying terms from the two expansions without involving c terms. But in the original problem, we have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first expansion, and it's multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes c terms. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists in the product, but it's multiplied by different powers of c. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first expansion multiplied by the sum of the coefficients from the second expansion. Wait, but in the example, that approach gave a non-zero coefficient, but in reality, the coefficient was zero. So, perhaps that approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the example, the first expansion is degree 2 in a and b, and the second expansion is degree 1 in c and 1/c. So, when you multiply, you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) because that would require multiplying two terms from the first expansion, but you're only multiplying each term by one term from the second expansion. So, in the original problem, with \\((a + b)^4\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) exists, and when you multiply it by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the sum of all these coefficients, which is 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But in the example, the sum of coefficients in the second expansion is 2, so 6 * 2 = 12, but in reality, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero because you can't get \\(a^2b^2\\) without involving c terms. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product can only come from multiplying the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first expansion by the constant term in the second expansion. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term involving c, you get a term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which is not just \\(a^2b^2\\). Therefore, the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) without any c terms is to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term in the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the coefficient of the constant term in the second expansion.\n\nIn the original problem, the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The constant term is when the exponent of c is zero. So, using the binomial theorem, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). Setting 6 - 2k = 0, we get k = 3. Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 20 = 120.\n\nIn the example I considered earlier, \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\), the constant term in the second expansion is when 6 - 2k = 0, but in that case, n = 1, so the general term is \\(\\dbinom{1}{k}c^{1 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{1}{k}c^{1 - 2k}\\). Setting 1 - 2k = 0, we get k = 0.5, which is not an integer, so there is no constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero, which matches our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120.\n\nTherefore, after carefully considering, the coefficient is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem to expand each part separately and then combine the results.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   We need the constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0). Setting \\(6 - 2k = 0\\) gives \\(k = 3\\). The coefficient of the constant term is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each expansion. Therefore, the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

So, the coefficient is 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is part of the first factor. So, does that mean that the second factor doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are different variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if we take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and multiply it by some term from the second part that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, so when we multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But since we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we don't care about the \\(c\\) terms; we just need to know how many times \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which is once, multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part, which are terms involving powers of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), we have to consider that each term in the product will have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the question is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all possible terms from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would then be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each term contributes a coefficient, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is being multiplied by each of those, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms would be the product of the coefficients. Wait, no, actually, each term in the product will have a specific combination of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). So, if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then we can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion has a coefficient, and when you multiply by \\(a^2b^2\\), it's like distributing that \\(a^2b^2\\) across all terms, each contributing their own coefficient. So, to find the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), we can compute the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and then multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of all coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if we set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the sum of all coefficients in the second part is 64. So, the total coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but in the entire expansion, each term will have some power of \\(c\\) as well. However, the problem doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so I think it's considering all possible terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). Therefore, the coefficient would indeed be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part, which is 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem had specified a particular power of \\(c\\), say \\(c^0\\), then we would have to compute the specific coefficient from the second part for that power and multiply by 6. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), without any condition on \\(c\\), I think it's safe to assume that we're summing over all possible coefficients from the second expansion. So, to recap: The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 * 64 = 384. I think that makes sense. Let me just double-check my calculations. First, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), that's correct. Then, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) evaluated at \\(c = 1\\) is \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\), which is also correct. So, multiplying them together gives 384. Yeah, I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\).\n\n\\boxed{384}"

Let me try to clarify: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), and the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), doesn't affect the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is just the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial, not a single number.

Let me check that. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\), so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems high.

If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then when I multiply them, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.

But wait, that can't be right because the second expansion isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial. So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial, which doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to rephrase: The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, which is a term that includes \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some combination of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But the problem doesn't specify any condition on \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, meaning that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which seems odd because coefficients are usually constants.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), and the problem is just asking for that polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems complicated, and I don't think that's what the problem is asking for. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the entire expansion and find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), which would be the constant term in the second expansion. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me think: If I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, and I want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, then I need to multiply the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, first, let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, maybe I'm overcomplicating it again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, which would mean that the coefficient is 6 times the entire \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), but that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the intended interpretation is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times \\(2^6 = 64\\), so 384. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), then each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m}(1/c)^m\\), which simplifies to \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}\\dbinom{6}{m}a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), that occurs when \\(4 - k = 2\\) and \\(k = 2\\). So, the term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) summed over all \\(m\\). But that's not a single number, so perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the constant term in \\(c\\). So, in that case, I need to find \\(m\\) such that \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 times 20, so 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the constant term in \\(c\\) is 120.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, which is 6, and the second part is just another factor that gets multiplied in, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), maybe it's 6 times the entire expansion of the second part, which would be 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), making the coefficient a polynomial. But that seems unlikely because the problem is probably expecting a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps the intended answer is 120, considering the constant term in \\(c\\).\n\nWait, let me try to verify this. If I expand \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Then, the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), when expanded, has terms involving \\(c^6, c^4, c^2, c^0, c^{-2}, c^{-4}, c^{-6}\\). So, when I multiply these together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each of these \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times each of these \\(c\\) terms, but if the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), then it's not a single number but a polynomial. So, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the constant term in the second expansion, which is 20, giving 120. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just expecting me to recognize that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest is irrelevant because it's multiplied by other terms involving \\(c\\). But that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the coefficients would combine. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 times the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20, giving 120. So, the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the constant term. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\cdot (1/c)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(k = 3\\). Then, the term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} c^{0} = 20\\). So, yes, the constant term is 20. Therefore, 6 times 20 is 120. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 120.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\). So, perhaps the intended answer is just 6, but that seems too simple. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion, but that would make it a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Therefore, I think the most reasonable interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem for both parts of the expression.\n\nFirst, consider the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n(a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n\\]\nThe term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n\\[\n\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n\\]\n\nNext, consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n\\[\n\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n\\]\nThe constant term (where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero) occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\).

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the expression isn't just \\((a + b)^4\\); it's multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the entire expression is the product of two binomials raised to powers. I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are involved, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think not directly because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would just be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms. Let me think again. When you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\).

But that doesn't make sense because the product would have terms involving both \\(a^2b^2\\) and various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, which is the product. So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But no, that's not correct because each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be found by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for some specific \\(k\\), but the problem doesn't specify a particular power of \\(c\\). It just says the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which might imply that we consider all possible powers of \\(c\\), effectively treating \\(c\\) as a separate variable. So, in that case, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 6 * 64 = 384. But let me verify that approach. Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider only the constant term in \\(c\\), i.e., the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Because if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps we're also looking for the term where \\(c\\) cancels out, making it a constant. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which might not make sense if we're just looking for a numerical coefficient. So, perhaps I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. So, let's approach it that way. First, find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, as I found earlier. Then, find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, how do I find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)? Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 * 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Now, since the original expression is the product of \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) (which is just \\(a^2b^2\\) since \\(c^0 = 1\\)) is the product of the coefficients we found: 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but earlier I thought it might be 384, but that was when I considered the sum of all coefficients in the second expression. However, since the problem is likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms, i.e., the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, the correct approach is to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expression and multiply it by the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expression. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Let me just double-check my reasoning. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. Since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. But if we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, then the coefficient would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, if the problem is implying that we want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), then it's 120. I think the problem is more likely asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), because otherwise, the coefficient would involve terms with different powers of \\(c\\), which isn't a single number. So, I think the correct answer is 120. Let me confirm this by considering the entire expansion. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 multiplied by each coefficient in the second expansion, but only the term where \\(c^0\\) would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. Yeah, I think that's the right approach.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^{2}b^{2} = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We want the exponent of \\(c\\) to be 0:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2m = 0 \\implies m = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the coefficients from both parts:**\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Does that mean I don't need to consider the \\(c\\) terms? Hmm, maybe not, because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times whatever the coefficient is for the \\(c\\) terms, but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), maybe I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) part. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the entire expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the \\(c\\) terms won't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at whatever term it is. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because when you multiply the two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\), which comes from the first part, it will be multiplied by every term from the second part. But since the second part is in terms of \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will have coefficients multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, maybe we can treat the second part as a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which means that each term in the expansion will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m\\) or something like that. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would be the sum of all the terms where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponent of \\(c\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all possible terms from the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, which would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you'd get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) for various \\(m\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself, without any \\(c\\) terms, would just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second part evaluated at the term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which would be the constant term. Wait, that might be it. So, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the constant term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant, which contributes to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). But if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by terms with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\), those would give terms like \\(a^2b^2c\\) or \\(a^2b^2/c\\), which aren't just \\(a^2b^2\\), so they don't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) itself. So, I think I need to find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), and then multiply it by 6 to get the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression.\n\nOkay, so let me find the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(1/c\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (the constant term from the second part), which is 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Then, in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, when you multiply the two, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by the constant term 20, giving \\(6 \u00d7 20 = 120\\), so the coefficient is 120.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second part, but only the constant term in the second part will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, because any other term would introduce a \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\) term, which would make the term \\(a^2b^2c^m\\) or \\(a^2b^2c^{-m}\\), which are not \\(a^2b^2\\) alone. So, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is why we multiply 6 by 20 to get 120. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients from each part, but only when the variables match. But since the second part doesn't have \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the only way the \\(a^2b^2\\) term is affected is by the constant term in the second part. So, yes, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. For example, suppose I have \\((a + b)^4\\) times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I were to write out the entire expansion, each term would be of the form \\(\\dbinom{4}{k}a^{4 - k}b^k \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would come from \\(k = 2\\), which gives \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}a^2b^2\\), and then multiplied by each term from the second expansion. But only when the second term is \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) would the resulting term be \\(a^2b^2\\) times that constant. All other terms would have \\(c\\) raised to some power, so they wouldn't contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, yes, only the constant term in the second expansion affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and that's 20. So, 6 \u00d7 20 = 120.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression is found by first determining the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) and then multiplying it by the constant term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). \n\n1. Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\).\n\n2. Expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The constant term occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\).\n\n3. Multiply the coefficients from both expansions:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}."

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me clarify. When you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose variables multiply to give that specific term. In this case, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product comes only from the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by any term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), any term in the second expansion will multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) to give a term that includes \\(c\\) raised to some power. However, the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering the \\(c\\) terms. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the entire expression is a product, so the terms are combined. But I think the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second part's expansion will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\).

Let me compute the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

Let me think again. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part, so its coefficient is 6, and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will have some power of \\(c\\), but since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, and the rest is about the \\(c\\) terms, which are separate. Wait, no, because when you multiply, the coefficients get multiplied as well. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all possible \\(k\\), which would be the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is indeed 64. So, the coefficient would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. If I have two expressions, \\( (a + b)^4 \\) and \\( (c + 1/c)^6 \\), and I multiply them, then each term in the product is a product of a term from the first and a term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first will be multiplied by each term in the second, which are of the form \\(c^k\\).

The sum of coefficients in the second expansion is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients multiply, but in this case, since we're looking for a specific term in one variable and any term in the other, we might need to sum over all possible terms in the second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would indeed be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions, and since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, the coefficient would be 6 times the entire second expression, but that doesn't make sense because the second expression isn't a single coefficient.

Let's consider that the entire product is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand both parts separately, the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will have terms like \\(a^4\\), \\(a^3b\\), \\(a^2b^2\\), etc., each with their coefficients. The expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) will have terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(c^5 \\times 1/c = c^4\\), and so on, each with their coefficients. Now, when I multiply these two expansions together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion will be multiplied by every term from the second expansion, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part (which is 6) multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, because each term in the second part contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by 6, gives the total contribution to \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nTo find the sum of all coefficients in the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), I can substitute \\(c = 1\\), which gives \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check with a smaller example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). Expanding, \\((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\\). The second part is \\(c + 1/c\\). Multiplying them, the product would be \\(a^2c + a^2(1/c) + 2ab c + 2ab(1/c) + b^2c + b^2(1/c)\\). Now, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) would be the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the first part, which is 1, multiplied by the sum of coefficients in the second part, which is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2\\) in the product would be 1 * 2 = 2. Looking at the product, the terms with \\(a^2\\) are \\(a^2c\\) and \\(a^2(1/c)\\), each with coefficient 1, so the total coefficient is 2, which matches 1 * 2. So, yes, that seems to work. Therefore, in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the product of the two expressions. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6, and the second part, when expanded, has 64 as the sum of its coefficients. So, when you multiply, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the product of the coefficients of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part and the constant term in the second part, but that doesn't seem right because the second part isn't a constant. Hmm, no, that approach is incorrect because the second part isn't a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the correct approach is to take the coefficient from the first part and multiply it by the sum of all coefficients in the second part, which is 64, leading to 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 384.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial theorem, which gives 6. The sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 64. Multiplying these gives 6 * 64 = 384.\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{384}."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that. \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to multiply this coefficient by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But hold on, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Because \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), right? So, when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms won't interact with the \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second expression doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient just remains 6 and doesn't get multiplied by anything else? Let me think again. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When I expand this, each term from the first expansion will be multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part (which is \\(6a^2b^2\\)) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other terms involve \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different variables, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is actually the same as the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, that can't be right because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, actually, when you multiply the two expressions, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part gets multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't affect it. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not an expression. Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible terms, but since \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\) are separate variables, the coefficient would just be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct either because the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, and the rest of the expression is multiplied by that. But wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of each term in the first polynomial get multiplied by the coefficients of each term in the second polynomial. But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first polynomial, and the second polynomial has no \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is just 6 multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should think differently. Let me write down the entire expression: \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, when I multiply this by the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is another expansion, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. However, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just 6 times the entire second expansion. But that doesn't make sense because the coefficient should be a single number, not an expression. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the question is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in other words, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that's not correct because the sum of coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), which is \\(2^6 = 64\\). So, if I multiply 6 by 64, I get 384. But that seems too high. Wait, no, that approach might not be correct because the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is indeed 64, but when you multiply the two polynomials, the coefficients of each term in the first are multiplied by the entire second polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by the entire second expansion, which is a sum of terms. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would then be 6 times the sum of all terms in the second expansion. But that's not correct because each term in the second expansion is a coefficient times a power of \\(c\\), so when you multiply by 6, you get a term like \\(6 \\times \\text{(coefficient of } c^k)\\) times \\(a^2b^2c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems too large. Let me check this again. The second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). The sum of its coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of all coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. But that seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, each term in the expansion would be of the form \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{(some coefficient)} \\times c^k\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion, which is 64, multiplied by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense. Because otherwise, if it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), the coefficient would be 384, which seems high. Let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. So, in that case, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, giving 384. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try another approach. Let's think about how the multiplication works. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and it's multiplied by every term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that can't be, because the coefficient should be a number, not a polynomial. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^k\\) would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^k\\) in the second expansion. But since the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without any restriction on \\(c\\), it's a bit ambiguous. But I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, that would mean summing over all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, and multiplying by 6, giving 384. Alternatively, if the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), that is, the term where \\(c\\) is raised to the zero power, then we need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is the middle term when \\(k = 3\\), because \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^3 \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^3 = \\dbinom{6}{3}c^0 = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) would be 6 times 20, which is 120. But the problem didn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so I'm not sure which interpretation is correct. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". It just says \\(a^2b^2\\), without any mention of \\(c\\). So, maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 times 64, which is 384. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that we're looking for the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out, i.e., \\(c^0\\), so the coefficient would be 6 times 20, which is 120. I think that's more likely what the problem is asking for because otherwise, the coefficient would be a very large number, and usually, such problems ask for specific terms. So, let me go with that. So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Therefore, first, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. Then, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, the final answer should be 120. But wait, let me make sure. Let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem. It's \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be zero, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. So, when we multiply by the 6 from the first part, we get 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (assuming \\(c^0\\)) is 120. But again, the problem didn't specify \\(c^0\\), so I'm a bit unsure. However, given that the problem is about \\(a^2b^2\\) and not about any specific power of \\(c\\), it's more likely that they just want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 6 * 64 = 384. But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check an example. Suppose I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^1\\). The expansion is \\((a^2 + 2ab + b^2)(c + 1/c)\\). The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero because there's no \\(a^2b^2\\) term. Wait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, if I have \\((a + b)^2 \\times (c + 1/c)^2\\). The expansion would include terms like \\(a^2c^2\\), \\(a^2\\), \\(a^2/c^2\\), etc. But the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still be zero because the second expansion doesn't have \\(b\\) terms. Wait, that's not correct because in this case, the second expansion is separate. So, in the product, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term would come from multiplying \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be \\(6 \\times (c^2 + 2 + 1/c^2)\\), meaning the coefficient is \\(6c^2 + 12 + 6/c^2\\). But that's not a single number; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is actually a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 12 in this smaller example. So, in the original problem, if we're looking for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then the coefficient is 120. Otherwise, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\), it's 6 times the entire expansion, which is a polynomial, not a single number. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is 120. So, I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term with \\(a^2b^2\\) occurs when \\(k = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} a^2b^2 = 6a^2b^2\n   \\]\n   So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   We need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) (the constant term) in this expansion because we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product.\n\n   Using the binomial theorem:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\n   \\]\n   To find the constant term (\\(c^0\\)), set the exponent equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   6 - 2k = 0 \\implies k = 3\n   \\]\n   The coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 20 = 120\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:** The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\boxed{120}\\)."

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, that part is clear; the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if this affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait a minute, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is only from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), right? The second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves variables \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which are different from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when I multiply the two expressions together, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) are all different variables, the only way \\(a^2b^2\\) can appear in the product is if it's multiplied by a term that doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), because otherwise, the variables would be mixed. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Actually, no, because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second. So, for the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, it would be multiplied by every term from the second part, which are terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression. That means we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the expression includes \\(c\\) terms as well. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" Hmm, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any combination of \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\). However, that doesn't make much sense because the problem just asks for the coefficient, not considering \\(c\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\) as separate variables, so the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by terms from the second part, each of which is a different term in \\(c\\). But then, the coefficient would actually be a sum of terms involving \\(c\\). Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term from the second part. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you multiply two polynomials, each term from the first is multiplied by each term from the second, so the coefficient of a specific term like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from the respective terms. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), without specifying any particular power of \\(c\\). That doesn't make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\), so the coefficient would actually be a polynomial in \\(c\\). Therefore, perhaps the problem is intended to consider the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by any term from the second expansion, meaning that the coefficient is the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by the 6 from the first part. Wait, that might make sense. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be 6 times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that's not quite right either. Let me clarify: The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part is 6a^2b^2. Then, when multiplied by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in the second part will have coefficients, and the entire expression will have terms like 6a^2b^2c^k, where k is from 0 to 6. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would actually be the sum of all the coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in the second part. But I'm not sure if that's what the problem is asking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. If that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. Let me check that interpretation. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so maybe it's just considering the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that would mean that the coefficient is a sum over all possible \\(c\\) terms, which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, because each term in the product is a combination of terms from both expansions. Let me try to approach this differently. Let me consider the entire expression as two separate parts: Part 1: \\((a + b)^4\\), which we've already expanded, and Part 2: \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Now, when you multiply these two, each term from Part 1 is multiplied by each term from Part 2. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from Part 1 will be multiplied by each term from Part 2, which are of the form \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2k}\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{k}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not considering \\(c\\). That is, it's asking for the coefficient when \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from Part 2, regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from Part 2 multiplied by 6. Wait, but that would give the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times the sum of all coefficients in Part 2. Let me calculate that. The sum of all coefficients in Part 2 is obtained by setting \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient would be \\(6 \\times 64 = 384\\). But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. That would make more sense because otherwise, the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. So, if that's the case, then I need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the product. To do that, I need to find the term in Part 2 where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. From Part 2, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). We want the exponent \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), so \\(6 - 2k = 0 \\Rightarrow k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient for \\(c^0\\) in Part 2 is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Then, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is the product of the coefficients from each part, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, that would be the answer. But I'm not entirely sure if the problem wants the coefficient considering all powers of \\(c\\) or just \\(c^0\\). Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" It doesn't specify any power of \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which isn't typical. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) as separate variables and is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times any power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is the sum over all possible exponents of \\(c\\), which would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in Part 2, which is 6 * 64 = 384. However, that seems unlikely because usually, when a problem asks for the coefficient of a specific term, it implies that the term is unique, i.e., it specifies all the exponents. Therefore, I think the intended interpretation is that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0 respectively. Therefore, the coefficient would be 6 * 20 = 120. So, I think the answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then multiplying it by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Therefore, the final coefficient is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by another binomial, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, the problem is only asking about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), not involving \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't depend on the other part? Or maybe I need to consider how the other part affects it? Let me think. Since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the other part is multiplied by the first binomial, I think I need to consider the entire expression. Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), so when I multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from those involving \\(c\\). So, when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it's just the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that might not make sense because \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term in one part, and the other part has \\(c\\) terms. So, actually, when you multiply them, you would get terms like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^k\\) or \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{-k}\\), but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. Hmm, so does that mean that the coefficient is just 6, regardless of the other expansion? Or is it that the coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion? Wait, no, because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, so in the product, each term would be a product of a term from the first expansion and a term from the second expansion. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the terms in the product would be of the form \\(a^k b^m c^n\\) or \\(a^k b^m c^{-n}\\), etc. So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), it would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, you get \\(a^2b^2 c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2 c^{-k}\\), etc., but the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) itself (without any \\(c\\) terms) would only come from the constant term in the second expansion. Wait, but the second expansion is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't have a constant term because all terms have either positive or negative exponents of \\(c\\). So, does that mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is zero? Because there's no term in the second expansion that is \\(c^0\\), so when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the second expansion, you can't get a term that's just \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. It says, \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)\". So, perhaps it's considering all the terms, and \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any power of \\(c\\), but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would still just be the coefficient from the first part, because the second part is multiplied by it. Wait, no, because each term in the product would have both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) exponents and \\(c\\) exponents. So, if we're just looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, then it would be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion would contribute a coefficient, and when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), it would give a term \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient, but with some power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), then perhaps we're just considering the coefficient from the first part, and the second part's coefficients would all add up to the total coefficient. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of it as two separate expansions. The first is \\((a + b)^4\\), which gives terms up to \\(a^4\\) and \\(b^4\\). The second is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which gives terms up to \\(c^6\\) and \\(c^{-6}\\). When you multiply them together, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. So, for example, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion would be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., \\(a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) for any \\(k\\) would be the product of the coefficients from each expansion. But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). Wait, that can't be, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would have to be multiplied by some power of \\(c\\), so unless \\(c^0\\) is considered, which it isn't in the second expansion. So, actually, there is no term in the product that is just \\(a^2b^2\\), because the second expansion doesn't have a constant term. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because the first part has a term \\(a^2b^2\\) with coefficient 6, and the second part has terms with coefficients, but since none of them are \\(c^0\\), when you multiply, you can't get a term without \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is zero. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression, considering all possible powers of \\(c\\). But in that case, the coefficient would be 6 multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the second expansion. Wait, but that's not correct either because each term in the product would have specific exponents. Let me clarify: when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate from \\(c\\), the exponents don't interfere. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) can be multiplied by any term from the second expansion, but the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because each term in the second expansion contributes a coefficient that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), gives a term with \\(a^2b^2\\) times that coefficient and some power of \\(c\\). So, if we're looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the \\(c\\) exponent, it's just 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is found by plugging in \\(c = 1\\). So, \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 * 64 = 384. But wait, earlier I thought that since the second expansion doesn't have a constant term, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be zero. Now I'm getting 384. I'm confused. Let me think again. If I set \\(c = 1\\), then the entire expression becomes \\((a + b)^4 \\times 2^6 = (a + b)^4 \\times 64\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in this case would be 6 * 64 = 384. But in reality, the original expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when \\(c\\) is not 1, the coefficients are spread out over different powers of \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\). So, in that case, it's 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second expansion, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. Alternatively, if the problem was asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), then it would be zero because there's no constant term in the second expansion. But since it's just \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of \\(c\\), it's 384. Hmm, I think that's the correct approach. So, the coefficient is 384.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so its coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the second part \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   To find the overall coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, we need to multiply the coefficient from the first part by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. This is because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of coefficients in the second part:**\n   The sum of coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1.

So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, does that affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, I think it does because when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But the problem is specifically asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The other part of the expression involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the terms, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means I need to consider the part of the second expression that doesn't change the variables \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Wait, but actually, no, because when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion, which includes terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), I think that the coefficient is just the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire second part. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the second part has multiple terms. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me clarify: The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When expanded, this is the product of two polynomials. Each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part, which has terms like \\(c^6\\), \\(6c^4\\), \\(15c^2\\), \\(20\\), \\(15c^{-2}\\), \\(6c^{-4}\\), and \\(c^{-6}\\). Therefore, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by all these terms, resulting in terms like \\(a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), etc. But the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would mean that the term must have \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by 1 (i.e., \\(c^0\\)), because any other power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. So, in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term with \\(c^0\\) is the constant term, which is the middle term when expanded. Let me find that. Using the binomial theorem again, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2m\\). We want the term where the exponent is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient from the first part, which is 6, multiplied by the constant term from the second part, which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6a\u00b2b\u00b2. Then, when multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, it becomes 6 * 20 a\u00b2b\u00b2 = 120a\u00b2b\u00b2. So, yes, the coefficient is 120. Alternatively, if I think about it as the entire product, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second, but since we're only interested in the term where the variables a and b have exponents 2, and c has exponent 0, it's just the product of the coefficients from each part where their respective exponents meet the requirement. So, yes, 6 * 20 = 120. I think that's correct.

So, maybe the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is just the same as the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, when you multiply two expressions together, the coefficients multiply as well, but in this case, since the second part is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), perhaps when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will just be multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), maybe the coefficient remains 6 regardless of the second part. Hmm, that seems right because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't interact with \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, perhaps the coefficient is indeed 6. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the multiplication works. If I have \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the product will have terms like \\(a^4c^6\\), \\(a^4c^5\\), etc., but the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. However, since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), and none of the terms in the second expansion affect the exponents of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be 6 times whatever the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is. Wait, no, that's not right because each term in the second expansion is a separate term, so actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. But wait, the sum of the coefficients in any expression is found by setting all variables to 1. So, the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) would be when \\(c = 1\\), so it's \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 multiplied by 64, which is 384. Hmm, that seems different from my initial thought. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), and I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the second expansion. But since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion. The sum of the coefficients in the second expansion is indeed 64, as calculated before. So, 6 times 64 is 384. So, the coefficient is 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficient of a specific term is the product of the coefficients of the corresponding terms in each polynomial. But in this case, the second polynomial doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) terms, so when you multiply, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first polynomial is multiplied by every term in the second polynomial, each contributing a different power of \\(c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), then yes, the coefficient would be 6 times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the entire expression being a product of two polynomials, and when you multiply them, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire second polynomial, but since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's consider that the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), can be expanded using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term in this expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). Now, when we multiply this by \\((a + b)^4\\), which has a term \\(6a^2b^2\\), the product will have terms like \\(6a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each of these terms will have the form \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} a^2b^2 c^{6 - 2m}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum over all m from 0 to 6 of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\), because each term contributes a coefficient to \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of c. But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c. So, that coefficient is 6 multiplied by the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6, which is 6 * 2^6 = 6 * 64 = 384. \n\nWait, but another way to think about it is that when you have two polynomials multiplied together, the coefficient of a specific term in the product is the sum of the products of the coefficients of terms whose exponents add up to the desired term. But in this case, since the second polynomial doesn't involve a or b, the exponents of a and b are only determined by the first polynomial. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just the coefficient from the first polynomial, 6, multiplied by the entire second polynomial. But since we're only interested in the coefficient, not the specific term, it's 6 times the sum of the coefficients in the second polynomial, which is 64, so 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the product of the two polynomials. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first polynomial times the sum of all coefficients in the second polynomial. Because when you multiply, each term in the first polynomial is multiplied by each term in the second, but since the second doesn't have a or b, the a^2b^2 term will just be scaled by each term in the second polynomial, so the total coefficient is 6 * (sum of coefficients in second polynomial). \n\nWait, but let me confirm with a simpler example. Suppose I have (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c)^1. Then, expanding, (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) * (c + 1/c). The coefficient of a^2b^2 would be zero because in the first polynomial, the highest power of a is 2 and b is 0, and so on. Wait, no, actually, in this case, the first polynomial is (a + b)^2, so it's a^2 + 2ab + b^2. The second polynomial is c + 1/c. When multiplied, the terms would be a^2c, a^2*(1/c), 2ab*c, 2ab*(1/c), b^2c, b^2*(1/c). So, none of these terms have a^2b^2, so the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero. Hmm, so in this case, the coefficient is zero, which is different from 2 * (sum of coefficients in second polynomial) which would be 2*(1 + 1) = 4. But in reality, the coefficient is zero. So, my earlier reasoning was wrong.\n\nWait, so that means that my approach is incorrect. Because in this simpler case, the coefficient isn't 2 * 2 = 4, it's zero. So, perhaps I need a different approach. \n\nWait, so perhaps the initial idea that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial is wrong. Because in the simpler case, it's not just 2 times 2, it's zero. So, why is that? Because in the first polynomial, the term a^2b^2 doesn't exist in (a + b)^2, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it still doesn't exist. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial because in (a + b)^4, the term a^2b^2 does exist, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, it would contribute to the coefficient.\n\nWait, but in the example I just did, (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c), the term a^2b^2 doesn't exist in (a + b)^2, so when multiplied, it's zero. But in the original problem, (a + b)^4 has a^2b^2, so when multiplied by the second polynomial, which is in terms of c, the a^2b^2 term would be present in the product, with a coefficient equal to 6 times the sum of coefficients in the second polynomial. So, perhaps in that case, it's 6 * 64 = 384. But in my simpler example, (a + b)^2 doesn't have a^2b^2, so the coefficient remains zero. So, perhaps in the original problem, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I'm confusing the way the coefficients interact. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the entire expansion. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let's denote the first part as P = (a + b)^4 and the second part as Q = (c + 1/c)^6. Then, the product P * Q will have terms that are products of terms from P and terms from Q. Now, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) in P is a term from P, and when multiplied by any term from Q, it will produce a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times c^{6 - 2m}\\) where m is from 0 to 6. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, then each multiplication of \\(a^2b^2\\) by a term from Q will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P * Q is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in P multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in Q. Because each term in Q contributes its coefficient when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). \n\nWait, but in my earlier example, when I had (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) was zero because (a + b)^2 doesn't have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, in that case, the coefficient is zero. But in the original problem, since (a + b)^4 does have an \\(a^2b^2\\) term, its coefficient is 6, and when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64, gives 6 * 64 = 384. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think about how the coefficients work when you multiply two polynomials. Suppose P(x) = p0 + p1x + p2x^2 + ... and Q(x) = q0 + q1y + q2y^2 + ..., then the product P(x)Q(y) would have terms like pikx^k y^l. So, the coefficient of x^k y^l would be the product of the coefficients from P and Q. But in our case, P is in terms of a and b, and Q is in terms of c. So, when you multiply P and Q, each term in P is multiplied by each term in Q, resulting in terms like a^{4 - k}b^k c^{6 - m} (1/c)^m. But since a, b, and c are different variables, the exponents don't interfere. So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 would be the coefficient from P times the sum of all coefficients from Q, because each term in Q is multiplied by a^2b^2, contributing their coefficients to the overall coefficient of a^2b^2 in the product.\n\nWait, but in the example I did earlier, (a + b)^2 * (c + 1/c), the coefficient of a^2b^2 is zero because (a + b)^2 doesn't have an a^2b^2 term. So, that makes sense. So, in the original problem, since (a + b)^4 does have an a^2b^2 term with coefficient 6, when multiplied by the sum of coefficients in Q, which is 64, we get 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me try another way. Let me compute the entire expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) and see what the coefficient is. As I did before, \\((a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4\\). So, the coefficient of a^2b^2 is 6. Now, when I multiply this by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which expands to terms involving c and 1/c, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(6a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. So, each of these terms will contribute a coefficient of \\(6 \\times \\dbinom{6}{m}\\) to the term \\(a^2b^2c^{6 - 2m}\\). But since the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of c, we need to sum all these coefficients. That is, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is \\(6 \\times \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m}\\). \n\nWait, but the sum of \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) from m=0 to 6 is 2^6 = 64. So, the coefficient is 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is 384.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using multinomial coefficients or generating functions. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire expression as a product of two independent expansions, so the coefficients multiply when the variables are separate. But in this case, the variables are separate, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed the product of the coefficient from the first part and the sum of coefficients from the second part. So, 6 * 64 = 384.\n\nWait, but to be thorough, let me compute \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) and confirm that the sum of its coefficients is 64. Expanding \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - m} \\times (1/c)^m = \\dbinom{6}{m}c^{6 - 2m}\\). The coefficients are \\(\\dbinom{6}{m}\\) for m from 0 to 6. The sum of these coefficients is when c = 1, so \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 64\\). So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is 6 * 64 = 384. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{384}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can use the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expand \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem:**\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, this expansion is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   The sum of the coefficients in this expansion is found by setting \\(c = 1\\), which gives:\n   \\[\n   (1 + 1)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6.

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) would be \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\). Let me compute that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. Now, the entire expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if that affects the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), so maybe the coefficients from the first part are independent of the second part. Let me think about that. So, the expression is a product of two expansions: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply when you take terms from each expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't interact with the terms involving \\(c\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part, and the second part is a separate variable. So, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem is asking for a coefficient, which is a number. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), meaning the term where \\(a\\) is squared, \\(b\\) is squared, and \\(c\\) is to the zero power. That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which isn't the case here. So, perhaps I need to consider both expansions and find the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by a term in \\(c\\) that results in \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. So, let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the \\((a + b)^4\\) part as before. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), because when I multiply the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by the constant term in the second expansion to give a term with \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). So, let me expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) using the binomial theorem as well. So, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, because that's the constant term. So, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the term where \\(m = 3\\) is the constant term. The coefficient for that term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion is 20.\n\nNow, since the original expression is the product of the two expansions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 120. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the first part gives me 6 for \\(a^2b^2\\), and the second part gives me 20 for \\(c^0\\), so multiplying them gives 120. That seems correct. Let me check my steps again.\n\n1. Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\) using the binomial theorem, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Correct.\n\n2. Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the general term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). To find the constant term, set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), so \\(m = 3\\). The coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Correct.\n\n3. Since the two expansions are multiplied together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion is multiplied by the constant term 20 from the second expansion, giving \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). So, the coefficient is 120. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)\" in the entire expression. But in the entire expression, \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, actually, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by each term in the second expansion, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be \\(6 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. So, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the power of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient would be a polynomial, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. That would make sense because then the coefficient is a number. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) only, and the other variables \\(c\\) are treated as constants, so the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems more complicated, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering only the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms, and the \\(c\\) terms are treated as separate. But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 6 times a polynomial, so the coefficient isn't a single number but a polynomial. That seems unlikely because the problem is asking for \"the coefficient\", which implies a single number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient when considering all variables, so the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 120. That makes sense because then it's a specific term. So, maybe the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), but it's written as \\(a^2b^2\\), assuming that \\(c\\) is at zero power. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) parts, and the \\(c\\) part is a separate factor, so the coefficient is 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would make the coefficient a polynomial, which doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-express the entire product and see. So, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). If I expand each part separately, then the product will have terms like \\(a^kb^{4 - k}\\) multiplied by \\(c^m / c^{6 - m}\\), which simplifies to \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to find all terms where \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), which is just \\(k = 2\\). So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is 6 times a polynomial, which is not a single number. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which would be 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120. So, that seems to be the case.\n\nWait, but to make sure, let me think again. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\).\" So, in the entire product, each term will be of the form \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^m / c^{6 - m}\\) = \\(a^kb^{4 - k}c^{2m - 6}\\). So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the power of \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be 6 times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, I think the problem must be asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is a specific term. So, the coefficient is 6 times the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second expansion, which is 6 times 20, which is 120.\n\nLet me just verify that once more. So, in the first expansion, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second expansion, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're looking for the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\), the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. So, the answer should be 120. I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in calculating the binomial coefficients. So, \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\) is 6, correct. \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\) is 20, correct. So, 6 * 20 is indeed 120. So, yes, the coefficient is 120.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, the final answer is 120.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is \\boxed{120}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expression \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), we can break down the problem into two parts using the binomial theorem.\n\n1. **Expanding \\((a + b)^4\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   (a + b)^4 = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\dbinom{4}{k} a^{4 - k}b^k\n   \\]\n   The term \\(a^2b^2\\) corresponds to \\(k = 2\\), so the coefficient is:\n   \\[\n   \\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Expanding \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\):**\n   Using the binomial theorem, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\n   \\]\n   We need the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, which occurs when \\(6 - 2m = 0\\).

Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I think I need to consider how these two parts interact. Wait, but the question is only about the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That is, in the entire product, we're looking for terms where \\(a\\) is squared and \\(b\\) is squared, regardless of what happens with \\(c\\). So, maybe I can treat each part separately and then multiply the coefficients. Let me think: since the expression is a product of two separate binomial expansions, each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).

But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the sum of all the coefficients in the second part. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients in the second part. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in the second expansion, each of those terms will contribute to the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, since the second expansion doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but what exactly is the sum of the coefficients in the second expansion? The sum of the coefficients in a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + \\dfrac{1}{1}\\right)^6 = (2)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients in the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 times 64, which is 384. Wait, but let me double-check that reasoning. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the second part doesn't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), each term in the second expansion is a constant with respect to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). So, when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term in the second expansion, the result will still have \\(a^2b^2\\) as a factor, but multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). So, when collecting like terms, all the terms from the second expansion will just scale the \\(a^2b^2\\) term by their coefficients. Therefore, the total coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product will be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, which is indeed 6 * 64 = 384. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the binomial coefficients.

In the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of coefficients is when \\(c = 1\\), so \\(2^6 = 64\\), which is correct. So, multiplying them together, 6 * 64 = 384.

So, the coefficient from the first part is 6. \n\nNow, the expression also has the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I need to consider this as well. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), not \\(c\\) or \\(1/c\\). So, does that mean the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. So, the entire expression is the product of two parts: \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you multiply these two, each term in the expansion of the first part will be multiplied by each term in the expansion of the second part. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we can ignore the terms involving \\(c\\) because they won't contribute to the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the entire expansion of the second part, but since we're only looking for \\(a^2b^2\\), the \\(c\\) terms don't matter. So, actually, maybe the coefficient is just 6 times the entire expansion of the second part? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because when you multiply two polynomials, each term in the first is multiplied by each term in the second. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), that means we need to consider how the \\(c\\) terms multiply, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is independent of \\(c\\), the coefficient will be 6 multiplied by the sum of all the coefficients in the second expansion, but that's not quite right either. Wait, no, actually, the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the product will be the product of the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from the first part and the constant term (i.e., the term with \\(c^0\\)) from the second part. Because if you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by any term involving \\(c\\), you'll get a term that includes \\(c\\), which we don't want. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part. \n\nSo, let me calculate the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). We want the term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so we set \\(6 - 2m = 0\\), which gives \\(m = 3\\). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = 20\\). \n\nSo, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). \n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Since we're multiplying these two expressions, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by each term in the second part. But since we only want the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), we need to multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the term in the second part that doesn't involve \\(c\\), which is the constant term, which has a coefficient of 20. So, yes, the total coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is found by first determining the coefficient in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). Next, we find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{120}\\)"

    "text": " So, the coefficient for \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2}\\), which is 6. So, that part is straightforward. Now, the expression also has \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Hmm, I wonder if I need to consider this part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is in the first part. So, maybe the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), is multiplied by the first part, but since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) don't involve \\(c\\), the terms involving \\(c\\) would just be coefficients for the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. So, perhaps I need to consider the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) as well and find its entire expansion, then multiply it by the \\(a^2b^2\\) term. But wait, no, that might not be necessary. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so that term would be in the first part, and the second part would contribute a coefficient that's multiplied by this term. So, maybe I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) because when I multiply everything together, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by each term from the second expansion, but if I'm only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), then any power of \\(c\\) would make it a different term. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any variables other than \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), so perhaps it's just considering the coefficient in the entire expression, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). That is, when you multiply the two expansions together, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the product of the coefficient from the first part and the entire expansion of the second part. But that doesn't make much sense because the second part is a polynomial in \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by \\(a^2b^2\\), you get a term like \\(a^2b^2 \\times\\) (something with \\(c\\)). So, perhaps the problem is only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product, regardless of the powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean that the coefficient is actually the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, ignoring the second part. But that seems unlikely because the entire expression is given as the product of both parts. Wait, let me check the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" So, it's the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product. That means I need to consider all terms in the product where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2 each, regardless of the exponents of \\(c\\). But wait, actually, no. Because when you multiply two expressions, each term from the first expression is multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I take the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part, which has a coefficient of 6, and multiply it by every term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), then each of these products will have the term \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by some power of \\(c\\). However, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which implies that it's considering \\(a^2b^2\\) as a standalone term, regardless of the \\(c\\) terms. But that's not possible because the entire expression is a product, so \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by various powers of \\(c\\). Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) when considering the entire expression as a polynomial in \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) would have a coefficient that is a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that seems complicated, and the problem is asking for the coefficient, so perhaps it's the sum of all coefficients from the second part, multiplied by 6. Wait, that might make sense. Let me think. If I expand \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the sum of all its coefficients would be when \\(c = 1\\). So, if I substitute \\(c = 1\\) into \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients of the second part is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 64 (sum of coefficients from the second part), giving 384. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, regardless of the second part, but that would be 6, which seems too simple given the entire expression. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider that the entire expression is a product of two independent expansions: one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and another in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them, each term from the first expansion is multiplied by each term from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first expansion multiplied by the entire second expansion. But that's not quite right because the second expansion is in terms of \\(c\\), so it's not a constant. Wait, but the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms from the second expansion multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\). So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second expansion. But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as another variable, but that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\). Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) regardless of the powers of \\(c\\), which would mean that the coefficient is the sum of all coefficients from the second expansion multiplied by 6. Wait, that seems more plausible. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). As I thought earlier, the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by substituting 1 for all variables. So, substituting \\(c = 1\\), we get \\((1 + 1)^6 = 64\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be 6 * 64 = 384. So, that's the answer. But let me verify this another way to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another approach is to consider that the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). When you expand this, each term will be of the form \\(a^{k}b^{4 - k} \\times c^{m} \\times (1/c)^{6 - m}\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 4, and \\(m\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, the general term is \\(\\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{k}b^{4 - k} c^{m - (6 - m)} = \\dbinom{4}{k} \\dbinom{6}{m} a^{k}b^{4 - k} c^{2m - 6}\\). Now, we are looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means we need \\(k = 2\\) and \\(4 - k = 2\\), so \\(k = 2\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{m} \\times c^{2m - 6}\\). But wait, the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which would include all the terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by different powers of \\(c\\). So, the coefficient is actually a polynomial in \\(c\\), but the problem might be asking for the coefficient as a numerical value, which would only make sense if we're considering the term independent of \\(c\\), i.e., where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps I misread the problem, and it's asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make more sense. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient where \\(2m - 6 = 0\\), which implies \\(m = 3\\). So, when \\(m = 3\\), the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero, and the term is \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\dbinom{4}{2} \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\), and \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) (specifically \\(a^2b^2c^0\\)) is 120. Hmm, so this contradicts my earlier conclusion of 384. So, which one is correct? Let me think carefully. The problem says: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\)?\" It doesn't specify anything about \\(c\\), so perhaps it's asking for the coefficient regardless of the power of \\(c\\), meaning that we need to sum over all possible powers of \\(c\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), i.e., the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0\\). That would make sense because otherwise, the coefficient would depend on \\(c\\), which is a variable, and the problem is likely expecting a numerical answer. So, in that case, we need to find the coefficient where the exponents of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are 2, 2, and 0, respectively. Therefore, we set \\(k = 2\\) (for \\(a^2b^2\\)) and \\(m = 3\\) (to get \\(c^0\\)). So, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} \\times \\dbinom{6}{3}\\), which is 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check this. Alternatively, if I consider that the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) without any restrictions on \\(c\\), then the coefficient would be the product of the coefficient from the first expansion and the entire second expansion, which would be 6 * \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But that would mean the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which doesn't make sense because the problem is asking for a numerical coefficient. Therefore, it's more likely that the problem is asking for the coefficient where \\(c^0\\) is present, i.e., the constant term with respect to \\(c\\). So, that would be 120. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the given expression is found by considering the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both 2 and the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0. Using the binomial theorem, the coefficient from \\((a + b)^4\\) is \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). For \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), the term where \\(c^0\\) occurs is when \\(m = 3\\), giving \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"

Let me calculate that: \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = \\dfrac{4!}{2!2!} = \\dfrac{24}{4} = 6\\). So, the coefficient is 6. But wait, that's just the first part. The entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the coefficient. Hmm, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). That means I don't need to worry about the \\(c\\) terms when looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). Because \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient will just be the product of the coefficients from each part, provided that the other terms don't affect it. Wait, no, actually, when you multiply two expressions together, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since we're only interested in terms where \\(a^2b^2\\) appears, and the second expression is in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), which don't involve \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) has multiple terms, each with their own coefficients, but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), I think the coefficient remains the same as in \\((a + b)^4\\). Wait, no, that's not correct because when you multiply two expressions, the coefficients multiply as well. Wait, but in this case, \\((a + b)^4\\) and \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) are separate, so when you multiply them, each term from \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other expression doesn't have any \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of all the terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that's not right either. Because when you multiply two polynomials, the coefficients of the product are the products of the coefficients of the terms that combine to form the desired term. But in this case, since \\(a^2b^2\\) doesn't involve \\(c\\), the only way to get \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product is to take the \\(a^2b^2\\) term from \\((a + b)^4\\) and multiply it by the constant term (in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) from \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But wait, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't have any constant term in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); it's all in terms of \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But that seems too broad. Wait, no, I think I'm confusing things. Let me try a different approach. The expression is \\((a + b)^4 \\times \\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from \\((a + b)^4\\), and the other part \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) doesn't affect the \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) terms. So, when you multiply, each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the sum of all the coefficients in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, that might be the case. Let me check. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the sum of the coefficients of all terms in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), you get terms like \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) and \\(a^2b^2/c^k\\), but since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and \\(c\\) is zero (i.e., the constant term in \\(c\\)), but wait, there is no constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Because when you expand \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the exponents of \\(c\\) will range from 6 down to -6 in steps of 2, I think. So, there is no term where the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would actually be zero because there's no constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is asking for the coefficient, implying that it's a non-zero value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try again. When you multiply \\((a + b)^4\\) by \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), each term in \\((a + b)^4\\) is multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from \\((a + b)^4\\) will be multiplied by each term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), resulting in terms like \\(6a^2b^2c^6\\), \\(6a^2b^2c^4\\), ..., down to \\(6a^2b^2c^{-6}\\). But the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is the term where the exponents of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are 2, and the exponent of \\(c\\) is zero. Since there is no term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\) with \\(c^0\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is zero. Wait, that seems to make sense. So, the coefficient is zero because there's no constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), so when you multiply, there's no term that would contribute to \\(a^2b^2\\) without any \\(c\\) terms. Therefore, the coefficient is zero. But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the expansion of \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\). The general term in the expansion is \\(\\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - k}(1/c)^k = \\dbinom{6}{k}c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponents of \\(c\\) are \\(6 - 2k\\) where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to 6. So, possible exponents are 6, 4, 2, 0, -2, -4, -6. Wait, when \\(k = 3\\), \\(6 - 2*3 = 0\\). So, there is a constant term when \\(k = 3\\). So, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}c^{0} = 20\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which is 20. So, 6 * 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, that makes sense now. I initially thought there was no constant term, but actually, when \\(k = 3\\), the exponent is zero, so the constant term is 20. So, the coefficient is 6 * 20 = 120.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is 6. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is 20.

Okay, so the coefficient from the first part is 6. Now, the entire expression is \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, I need to consider how this multiplication affects the term \\(a^2b^2\\). Wait, but the second part of the expression is only in terms of \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply them, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) won't be affected by the \\(c\\) terms. That means the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression will just be the same as the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Actually, when you multiply two expressions, each term in the first expression gets multiplied by each term in the second expression. But since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are separate variables from \\(c\\), the \\(a^2b^2\\) term in the first part won't combine with any \\(c\\) terms in the second part. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product will just be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) times the entire expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is a sum of terms involving different powers of \\(c\\), but since we're only looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't involve \\(c\\), the coefficient should actually be the product of the coefficients from each part. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Let me clarify. The term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes only from the first part of the product, \\((a + b)^4\\), and when you multiply by the second part, which is \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), each term in the expansion of \\((a + b)^4\\) gets multiplied by each term in the expansion of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part will be multiplied by every term in the second part. However, since we're interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that doesn't involve \\(c\\), we need to find the sum of all the terms in the second expansion that, when multiplied by \\(a^2b^2\\), result in a term that doesn't have \\(c\\). But wait, \\(a^2b^2\\) is a term with no \\(c\\), so when you multiply it by any term from the second expansion, which has some power of \\(c\\), the resulting term will have \\(a^2b^2c^k\\) where \\(k\\) is the exponent from the second expansion. But since we're only interested in the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which doesn't have any \\(c\\) terms, that means we need the term in the second expansion that has \\(c^0\\), i.e., the constant term. Because when you multiply \\(a^2b^2\\) by the constant term, you get \\(a^2b^2 \\times \\text{constant}\\), which is just a term with \\(a^2b^2\\). If you multiply by any other term with \\(c^k\\) where \\(k \\neq 0\\), you'd get a term with \\(a^2b^2c^k\\), which isn't the term we're interested in. So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) multiplied by the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Therefore, I need to find two things: 1. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which I found earlier to be 6. 2. The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Let me work on finding the constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). Again, using the binomial theorem, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6 = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - m} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^m = \\sum_{m=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). So, each term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{m} c^{6 - 2m}\\). The constant term is when the exponent of \\(c\\) is 0, so \\(6 - 2m = 0\\). Solving for \\(m\\), we get \\(2m = 6\\), so \\(m = 3\\). Therefore, the constant term is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). Wait, that's not correct. Wait, 6! is 720, but 3! is 6, so 3!3! is 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. So, 720 / 36 is indeed 20. So, the constant term is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression is 6 (from the first part) multiplied by 20 (from the constant term in the second part), so 6 \u00d7 20 = 120. Therefore, the coefficient is 120. Wait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. First, I found the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) correctly as 6. Then, I needed the constant term in \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), which I found by setting the exponent to 0, which gave me m=3, and the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying 6 and 20 gives 120, which seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\) is found using the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{4}{2} = 6\\). The constant term in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = 20\\). Multiplying these together gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n**Answer:** The coefficient is \\boxed{120}."

So, the entire expression is the product of two binomial expansions. So, when I expand both, I'll have terms like \\(a^2b^2\\) multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), regardless of the \\(c\\) terms, I just need to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part, and then the second part will just multiply that term by some other terms, but since \\(a^2b^2\\) is only in the first part, the coefficient remains 6. Alternatively, if the problem had asked for a term that included both \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), then I would have to consider the product, but since it's only about \\(a^2b^2\\), the coefficient is just 6.

So, the coefficient from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), is 6. Now, the expression is multiplied by \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). I wonder if I need to consider that part as well. Wait, but the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\). So, does that mean that the term \\(a^2b^2\\) comes from the first part, and the second part might contribute other variables, but since we're only interested in \\(a^2b^2\\), perhaps the second part doesn't affect the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\)? Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because when you multiply two expressions together, each term from the first expression gets multiplied by each term from the second expression. So, if I'm looking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), I need to consider all the terms in the expansion where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by any term from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), which is a term that only involves \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The second part of the expression, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), involves \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\), so when I multiply the two expansions together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\).

Wait, no, that can't be right because each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) would be the coefficient from the first part times the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because \\(a^2b^2\\) would be multiplied by every possible term in the second expansion. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the second part isn't just a constant; it's a polynomial in \\(c\\). So, actually, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire expression would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part multiplied by the entire second part, but that seems off because the second part has terms with \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product, but considering all possible terms, so the coefficient would be the coefficient from the first part times the entire second part, but that would result in a polynomial in \\(c\\). But the problem is just asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\), so perhaps the answer is just the coefficient from the first part, 6, multiplied by the entire second expression, but that seems incorrect because the second part isn't a constant. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me read the problem again: \"What is the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\).\" So, the entire expression is a product of two polynomials, one in \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and the other in \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, when you multiply them together, the terms involving \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) will be multiplied by terms involving \\(c\\) and \\(1/c\\). So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) will be multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each with their own coefficients. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the first part times the entire second expression. But that can't be right because the second expression is not a single term. Wait, no, that's not correct. The coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the product would actually be the coefficient from the first part multiplied by the sum of all coefficients from the second part, because each term in the first part is multiplied by each term in the second part. But wait, that would mean that the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6 times the sum of the coefficients of \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\). But the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by setting all variables to 1. So, if I set \\(c = 1\\), then \\(\\left(1 + 1\\right)^6 = 2^6 = 64\\). So, the sum of the coefficients is 64. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times 64, which is 384. But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is just 6, because the second part is multiplied as a whole, but that doesn't seem right either. Wait, no, because when you multiply, each term in the first expansion is multiplied by each term in the second expansion. So, the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first part is multiplied by every term in the second expansion, each of which has its own coefficient. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the entire product would be 6 times the entire second expansion. But that would mean that the coefficient is a polynomial in \\(c\\), which contradicts the problem's wording, because it's asking for a coefficient, which is a number. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in the expansion, treating \\(c\\) as a variable, but then the coefficient would be a polynomial in \\(c\\). But that doesn't seem likely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) times \\(c^0\\), meaning the term where the exponents of \\(c\\) cancel out. That is, the term where the power of \\(c\\) is zero. So, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\). That would make sense because then the coefficient would be a number. So, let me assume that the problem is actually asking for the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\), which is the term where \\(a^2b^2\\) is multiplied by \\(c^0 = 1\\). So, to find this, I need to consider the term \\(a^2b^2\\) from the first expansion and the term \\(c^0\\) from the second expansion. Therefore, the coefficient would be the product of the coefficients from each part. So, first, from the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is 6, as I found earlier. Now, from the second part, \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I need to find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\). Let me compute that. To find the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), I can use the binomial theorem again. The expansion is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - k} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{6} \\dbinom{6}{k} c^{6 - 2k}\\). So, the exponent of \\(c\\) is \\(6 - 2k\\). We want the exponent to be 0, so \\(6 - 2k = 0\\), which implies \\(k = 3\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(\\dbinom{6}{3}\\). Calculating that, \\(\\dbinom{6}{3} = \\dfrac{6!}{3!3!} = \\dfrac{720}{6 \\times 6} = \\dfrac{720}{36} = 20\\). So, the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in the second part is 20. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2c^0\\) in the entire product is the product of the two coefficients, which is \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\). Therefore, the answer should be 120. Let me double-check that. So, in the first part, \\((a + b)^4\\), the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) is indeed 6. In the second part, \\(\\left(c + 1/c\\right)^6\\), the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) is 20. Multiplying them gives 120. So, yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4 \\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\) is found by first determining the coefficient of \\(a^2b^2\\) in \\((a + b)^4\\), which is 6, and then finding the coefficient of \\(c^0\\) in \\(\\left(c + \\dfrac{1}{c}\\right)^6\\), which is 20. Multiplying these gives \\(6 \\times 20 = 120\\).\n\n\\boxed{120}"
